## Summary
NVIDIA Ada Lovelace Architecture is an NVIDIA GPU generation for RTX graphics, professional visualization, workstation AI, and CUDA compute. NVIDIA's CUDA docs include Ada compatibility and tuning guides for developers targeting Ada GPUs.

## Detail
The Ada compatibility guide covers application compatibility for CUDA applications built with CUDA Toolkit versions before and around Ada support. The tuning guide says Ada retains and extends the CUDA programming model from Ampere and Turing, so applications following existing best practices typically see speedups without source changes, while additional tuning can exploit Ada-specific features.

In the wiki, Ada connects CUDA compute, RTX rendering, DLSS, workstation AI, and client/professional GPU workflows.

## Connections
- [[NVIDIA-RTX]] - Ada is a major RTX architecture generation.
- [[NVIDIA-DLSS]] - Ada-era RTX GPUs support AI rendering features.
- [[NVIDIA-Ampere-Architecture]] - predecessor architecture referenced by Ada tuning docs.
- [[NVIDIA-Turing-Architecture]] - earlier RTX architecture and CUDA tuning reference point.
- [[CUDA-Compatibility]] - Ada compatibility depends on CUDA toolkit and driver support.
