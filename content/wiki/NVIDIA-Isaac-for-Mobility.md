## Summary
NVIDIA Isaac for Mobility is the current Isaac ROS reference-workflow area for autonomous mobile robot mobility, continuing the work previously branded as Isaac Perceptor. The latest Isaac ROS documentation marks the page as a current Thor-optimization direction and points legacy Perceptor details to older docs, so this wiki page keeps the current name canonical while preserving Perceptor as a search alias.

## Detail

### Purpose
Isaac for Mobility is the current landing point for NVIDIA's AMR mobility workflow in Isaac ROS. It connects accelerated perception, stereo depth, mapping, localization, pose estimation, navigation costmaps, and Jetson deployment into a mobility stack for robots that must understand and move through physical spaces.

### Current documentation status
- The current Isaac ROS docs state that Isaac for Mobility continues the Isaac Perceptor work.
- NVIDIA notes that the current optimization focus is Jetson Thor; older Isaac Perceptor docs remain the historical reference for some workflow details.
- Because the current page is a durable docs surface but still sparse, related implementation details should be linked through [[NVIDIA-Isaac-ROS]], [[Isaac-ROS-nvblox]], visual SLAM, mapping/localization, and stereo-depth pages instead of creating many thin subpages.

### Key capabilities
- Mobility workflow identity for AMR perception, mapping, localization, and navigation.
- Integration point for [[Isaac-ROS-Visual-SLAM]], [[Isaac-ROS-Visual-Global-Localization]], [[Isaac-ROS-nvblox]] 3D reconstruction, and 2D costmaps for path planning.
- Stereo-depth and perception components, including [[Isaac-ROS-FoundationStereo]] where deep stereo disparity is useful.
- DNN perception components such as [[Isaac-ROS-DNN-Inference]] and [[Isaac-ROS-Object-Detection]] for robot scene understanding.
- [[Isaac-ROS-NITROS]] as the accelerated transport layer under high-throughput perception graphs.
- Jetson-focused deployment path, especially current [[NVIDIA-Jetson-Thor]] and Jetson/JetPack compatibility signals in Isaac ROS release notes.
- Simulation and validation path through [[NVIDIA-Isaac-Sim]] and ROS 2 integration.

### NVIDIA context
Isaac for Mobility is the mobile-robot counterpart to [[NVIDIA-Isaac-for-Manipulation]]. Together, they organize current Isaac ROS reference workflows around two physical AI deployment patterns: robots that manipulate objects and robots that navigate spaces.
