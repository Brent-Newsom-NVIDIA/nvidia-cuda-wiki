## Summary
CUDA Compatibility defines how CUDA applications and toolkit components run across NVIDIA driver versions. It matters most in enterprise, data center, and managed cluster environments where application/toolkit upgrades and driver qualification schedules do not always move at the same pace.

## Detail

### Compatibility modes
- **Minor Version Compatibility:** CUDA 11 and later allow applications within a major CUDA release family to run on sufficiently new drivers, with documented limits.
- **Forward Compatibility:** CUDA compatibility packages allow some newer toolkit-built applications to run on older supported base drivers.
- **Driver/toolkit planning:** Compatibility guidance helps platform owners decide when a driver update is mandatory versus when a toolkit or container update can proceed independently.
- **Architecture binary compatibility:** architecture-specific guides such as [[CUDA-Blackwell-Compatibility-Guide]], [[CUDA-Hopper-Compatibility-Guide]], and [[CUDA-Ampere-Compatibility-Guide]] cover PTX/cubin compatibility for GPU generations.

### NVIDIA context
CUDA Compatibility is critical for [[NVIDIA-DGX]], Kubernetes GPU clusters, [[NVIDIA-AI-Enterprise]], and containerized workflows using [[NVIDIA-Container-Toolkit]] or [[NVIDIA-GPU-Operator]]. It reduces operational friction while preserving known constraints around driver features, GPUs, and supported platforms.
