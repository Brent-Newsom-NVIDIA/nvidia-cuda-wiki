## Summary
NVIDIA Morpheus is a GPU-accelerated, end-to-end AI framework for cybersecurity applications, enabling real-time analysis of streaming security data for threat detection and automated response. It reduces threat identification and response time through AI-powered workflows including digital fingerprinting, spear phishing detection, and graph-based fraud detection. Available as open-source and through NVIDIA AI Enterprise.

## Detail

### Purpose
Security operations centers (SOCs) are overwhelmed by the volume and velocity of security telemetry data. Morpheus addresses this by providing GPU-accelerated AI pipelines that can process large streams of network, endpoint, and application data in real time, reducing the time from threat occurrence to detection from hours to seconds.

### Key Features
- GPU-accelerated, end-to-end AI inference on streaming security data
- Real-time analysis and automated threat response
- Digital Fingerprinting: creates user/device behavioral profiles to detect anomalies
- Spear Phishing Detection: AI-powered identification of targeted phishing attacks
- Graph Neural Network (GNN) based fraud detection
- Sensitive information detection (PII, credentials)
- Synthetic data generation for training AI security models
- What-if scenario modeling for threat simulation
- Integration with NVIDIA Triton Inference Server
- Deployment via Docker containers, native builds, or NVIDIA NGC
- Helm charts and Jupyter Notebooks for rapid deployment

### Use Cases
- Network anomaly detection and intrusion prevention
- Email security and phishing detection
- Insider threat detection via behavioral analytics
- Financial fraud detection using graph neural networks
- Log analysis and SIEM acceleration
- SOC automation and alert triage
- Sensitive data discovery in enterprise environments

### Hardware Requirements
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- Optimized for data center GPUs (A100, H100)
- Production support via NVIDIA AI Enterprise licensing
- Linux-based deployment environment

### Language Bindings
- Python (primary)
- Available via NVIDIA NGC containers
