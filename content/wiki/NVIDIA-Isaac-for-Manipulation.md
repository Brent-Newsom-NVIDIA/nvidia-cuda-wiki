## Summary
NVIDIA Isaac for Manipulation is the current Isaac ROS reference architecture for perception-driven robot-arm manipulation. It brings together GPU-accelerated perception, depth processing, 3D reconstruction, object pose estimation, robot configuration, and [[Isaac-ROS-cuMotion]] planning so a robotic arm can perform collision-aware manipulation tasks. Current Isaac ROS release notes identify this workflow family as the current name for the workflows formerly known as Isaac Manipulator.

## Detail

### Purpose
Isaac for Manipulation gives robotics teams a validated starting architecture for building accelerated pick-and-place, inspection, object-following, and contact-rich manipulation systems. The workflow is designed to run with real cameras and robots, with simulated robots in [[NVIDIA-Isaac-Sim]], and with deployment targets such as Jetson Orin or Ampere-and-newer NVIDIA GPU systems.

### Key capabilities
- Reference architecture for robotic arms using NVIDIA-accelerated Isaac ROS components.
- Visual input from live or simulated RGB/depth cameras, including stereo-depth paths such as [[Isaac-ROS-FoundationStereo]] or ESS.
- Environment and obstacle perception through [[Isaac-ROS-nvblox]] scene reconstruction.
- Object and goal-state estimation with pose-estimation components such as [[Isaac-ROS-FoundationPose]].
- DNN inference and object detection through [[Isaac-ROS-DNN-Inference]] and [[Isaac-ROS-Object-Detection]] when workflows need object candidates or model-backed perception.
- Robot configuration through URDF plus XRDF-style collision and configuration-space metadata.
- Collision-free, time-optimized motion planning through [[Isaac-ROS-cuMotion]] and MoveIt 2 integration.
- Accelerated ROS graph transport through [[Isaac-ROS-NITROS]].
- Sim-to-real tutorials that connect [[NVIDIA-Isaac-Lab]], [[NVIDIA-Isaac-Sim]], Isaac ROS, and physical robot execution.

### Current naming
- Isaac ROS 4.x documentation uses **Isaac for Manipulation** for this current reference-workflow area.
- Earlier public material may use **Isaac Manipulator**; keep that as an alias in search context, but keep this page as the canonical wiki page.
- Individual tutorials, bringup packages, orchestration packages, and robot-specific examples should be folded into this page or into the relevant durable component page instead of becoming separate wiki pages.

### NVIDIA context
Isaac for Manipulation is where NVIDIA's robotics deployment stack becomes an integrated manipulation workflow. It combines [[NVIDIA-Isaac-ROS]] packages, [[TensorRT]]-optimized perception models, [[NVIDIA-Isaac-Sim]] simulation, [[NVIDIA-Isaac-Lab]] policy workflows, and [[NVIDIA-Jetson-Platform]] deployment hardware into one robot-arm architecture.
