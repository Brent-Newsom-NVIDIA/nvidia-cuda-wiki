## Summary
CUDA-Q Realtime, also referenced as `cudaq-realtime`, is the CUDA-Q library for tightly coupling GPU-accelerated compute to a quantum processor control system through a low-latency networking layer. It is the software layer that makes [[NVIDIA-NVQLink]] programmable for microsecond-class GPU-to-quantum-controller feedback loops.

## Detail

### Purpose
Fault-tolerant quantum computing requires realtime classical processing while the QPU is operating. CUDA-Q Realtime gives developers and system integrators an API and networking layer for callbacks between GPUs and quantum controllers, enabling QEC decoding, calibration, and other realtime control workflows.

### Platform role
- Requires a host system with an NVIDIA GPU and ConnectX-7 or BlueField NIC, plus an FPGA connected to the NIC.
- Provides realtime co-processing between FPGA and CPU-GPU systems.
- Provides the low-latency networking layer of the NVQLink architecture.
- Uses an Ethernet/RoCE data path and references Holoscan Sensor Bridge for high-bandwidth transfer.
- Became publicly available through CUDA-Q around the GTC 2026 NVQLink release window.

### NVIDIA context
Use this page for the software/API layer. Use [[NVIDIA-NVQLink]] for the architecture and hardware integration story, [[CUDA-QX]] for QEC and solver libraries, and [[CUDA-Q]] for the broader programming model.
