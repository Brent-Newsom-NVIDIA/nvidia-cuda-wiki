## Summary
cuVS is NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated vector search library providing world-class performance for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search via its CAGRA algorithm. Part of the RAPIDS ecosystem, it accelerates vector search operations critical to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), recommendation systems, and semantic search at scale. It supports Python, C++, C, and Rust APIs.

## Detail

### Purpose
Vector search (finding the most similar vectors in a large database) is foundational to modern AI applications — RAG pipelines, recommendation systems, semantic search, and image retrieval all depend on fast ANN search. cuVS accelerates this on GPU, enabling orders-of-magnitude faster indexing and querying compared to CPU-based ANN libraries like FAISS or HNSW.

### Key Features
- World-class ANN performance via the CAGRA graph-based algorithm
- GPU-accelerated index build and query phases
- Multiple index types: CAGRA (graph-based), IVF-Flat, IVF-PQ, brute-force
- Multi-GPU support for large-scale vector databases
- Integration with popular ANN benchmarks (ANN-Benchmarks)
- Python, C++, C, and Rust APIs for broad ecosystem compatibility
- cuDF integration for DataFrame-native vector search pipelines
- Used as the backend for several vector database products
- Referenced in current [[NVIDIA-AI-Data-Platform]] material as the GPU-accelerated vector search and data clustering layer for semantic search workloads

### Use Cases
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for LLMs
- Semantic search over embedding databases
- Recommendation systems (item-to-item, user-to-item similarity)
- Image and video similarity search
- Drug discovery (molecular similarity search)
- Genomics (sequence similarity)
- Fraud detection via behavioral embedding similarity

### Hardware Requirements
- NVIDIA GPU, Volta or newer (Ampere/Hopper recommended for peak performance)
- CUDA 11.x or 12.x
- Linux (primary supported OS)
- Part of RAPIDS ecosystem

### Language Bindings
- Python (primary)
- C++ 
- C
- Rust
