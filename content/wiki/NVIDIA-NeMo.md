## Summary
NVIDIA NeMo is now best understood as a modular software suite for managing the AI agent lifecycle, not only as a training framework. Current NVIDIA docs organize NeMo across microservices, framework libraries, agent tooling, retrieval, guardrails, data curation, evaluation, customization, deployment, and blueprints.

## Detail

### Purpose
NeMo gives developers and enterprises a connected path for building, customizing, evaluating, protecting, deploying, and optimizing generative AI and agentic systems. It spans open-source training components, production microservices, and workflow tooling.

### Current architecture
- **[[NeMo-Platform]]:** Microservices for synthetic data, customization, evaluation, guardrails, inference, RBAC, and observability.
- **[[NeMo-Data-Designer]], [[NeMo-Customizer]], [[NeMo-Evaluator]], [[NeMo-Safe-Synthesizer]], and [[NeMo-Auditor]]:** first-class NeMo Platform services for synthetic datasets, model adaptation, model/RAG/agent evaluation, private tabular synthesis, and safety audits.
- **NeMo Framework:** Open-source framework for large-scale pretraining, post-training, reinforcement learning, multimodal models, and speech AI.
- **[[NeMo-AutoModel]], [[NeMo-RL]], [[NeMo-Run]], [[NeMo-Megatron-Bridge]], and [[NeMo-Export-Deploy]]:** current framework tooling for Hugging Face-compatible training, RL/post-training, experiment launch, Megatron conversion/training, and deployment handoff.
- **[[Nemotron-Training-Recipes]]:** current public Nemotron cookbook layer that combines NeMo Run, Megatron Bridge, NeMo RL, `nemo_runspec`, and artifact lineage for Nano3 and Super3 training/post-training.
- **[[NVIDIA-Agent-Intelligence-Toolkit]]:** Framework-agnostic workflow layer for agent development, profiling, evaluation, MCP, and A2A.
- **[[NeMo-Retriever]]:** Multimodal extraction, embedding, indexing, retrieval, and reranking for enterprise RAG.
- **[[NeMo-Guardrails]]:** Programmable safety, policy, and topical controls for LLMs and agents.
- **[[NVIDIA-NemoGuard-NIMs]]:** Deployable guardrail NIMs for content safety, topic control, and jailbreak detection.
- **[[NeMo-Curator]]:** GPU-accelerated data cleaning, filtering, and multimodal curation.
- **Export/deploy:** Production deployment through [[TensorRT]], [[TensorRT-LLM]], [[vLLM]], [[Triton-Inference-Server]], and [[NVIDIA-NIM]].
- **Speech NIM deployment:** current [[NVIDIA-Speech-NIM-Microservices]] docs package NeMo speech models into ASR, TTS, and NMT NIM containers.

### NVIDIA context
NeMo is the lifecycle layer around NVIDIA's model, inference, and AI software portfolio. [[Nemotron]] models can be trained/customized with [[NeMo-AutoModel]], [[NeMo-RL]], [[NeMo-Megatron-Bridge]], and [[NeMo-Customizer]], served through [[NVIDIA-NIM]], connected to data via [[NeMo-Retriever]], measured with [[NeMo-Evaluator]], protected by [[NeMo-Guardrails]], audited with [[NeMo-Auditor]], and orchestrated through [[NVIDIA-Agent-Intelligence-Toolkit]].
