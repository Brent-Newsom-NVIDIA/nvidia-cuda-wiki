## Summary
NVIDIA AI Data Platform is a reference design for bringing NVIDIA accelerated computing, networking, and AI software into enterprise storage and data systems. It is positioned as the AI factory data layer for ingestion, extraction, embedding, indexing, retrieval, RAG, video search, deep research agents, and context-aware distributed inference.

## Detail

### Purpose
Agentic AI depends on fresh, private, multimodal enterprise data. NVIDIA AI Data Platform is designed to help companies turn existing storage and data platforms into AI-ready systems that can feed agents and retrieval pipelines without moving every dataset into a separate AI silo.

### Reference workflows
- Multimodal agentic RAG over PDFs, graphics, audio, and text.
- Video search, summarization, and Q&A over live or archived media.
- Physical AI video search and curation using embeddings from [[NIM-for-Cosmos-Embed1]].
- Multimodal reasoning and visual generation over enterprise data using [[NIM-for-Vision-Language-Models]] and [[NIM-for-Visual-Generative-AI]].
- Deep research agents over private enterprise data.
- Centralized cache for distributed inference with [[NVIDIA-Dynamo]].
- Semantic search across large video datasets, including physical AI and autonomous-vehicle post-training data.

### Product layer
NVIDIA describes the platform as a combination of enterprise storage, accelerated infrastructure, and enterprise AI software. The product stack includes Blackwell GPUs, [[NVIDIA-BlueField-DPU]], [[NVIDIA-Spectrum-X]], [[NVIDIA-NIM]], [[NeMo-Retriever]], and [[cuVS]]. It also connects to [[NVIDIA-STX]] and [[NVIDIA-CMX]] for newer AI-native storage and context-memory designs.

### NVIDIA context
The AI Data Platform is the data-side counterpart to [[NVIDIA-Enterprise-AI-Factory]]. It links the physical data layer to [[NeMo-Retriever]], [[NVIDIA-NIM]], [[NVIDIA-AI-Q-Blueprint]], [[NVIDIA-Dynamo]], and [[NVIDIA-Certified-Storage]] so agents can retrieve, reason, and reuse context at production scale.
