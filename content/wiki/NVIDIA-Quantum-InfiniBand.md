## Summary
NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand is NVIDIA's line of high-performance InfiniBand switch silicon and switch systems designed for AI and HPC cluster interconnects. The Quantum-2 generation supports NDR (Next Data Rate) 400Gb/s per port InfiniBand with SHARP (Scalable Hierarchical Aggregation and Reduction Protocol) in-network computing for lossless all-reduce collective operations without host CPU involvement. NVIDIA InfiniBand is the dominant interconnect fabric in AI supercomputers, used in DGX SuperPODs and top HPC clusters worldwide.
This is a networking product family, not the [[NVIDIA-Quantum]] quantum-computing platform. The name overlap is important for search and disambiguation.

## Detail

### Purpose
At hyperscale AI training, the interconnect between GPUs becomes the performance bottleneck — tens of thousands of GPUs performing all-reduce gradient synchronization require microsecond latency and terabit-per-second bandwidth. NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand provides the lowest-latency, highest-bandwidth, and most feature-rich interconnect fabric available for this purpose, with SHARP offloading collective operations into the switch to reduce host CPU load and improve effective all-reduce bandwidth.

### Key Features
- Quantum-2 NDR: 400Gb/s per port (up to 64 ports per switch, total 25.6Tb/s switch bandwidth)
- SHARP (Scalable Hierarchical Aggregation and Reduction Protocol): in-network all-reduce and all-gather offload
- SHARP v3: supports FP32 and BF16 SHARP operations for LLM training
- RoCE support: InfiniBand switch can also support RoCEv2 for Ethernet-connected endpoints
- Sub-600ns port-to-port latency
- Adaptive routing for congestion avoidance in fat-tree topologies
- Co-design with ConnectX-7/8 NICs for end-to-end acceleration
- Future AI factory networking connects Quantum/InfiniBand concepts to [[NVIDIA-ConnectX-9]] and optical networking directions such as [[NVIDIA-Silicon-Photonics]]
- UFM (Unified Fabric Manager) integration for fabric management
- Used in NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, Selene, Eos AI supercomputers

### Use Cases
- Large-scale LLM training (GPT-4, LLaMA, Nemotron scale)
- HPC simulation: molecular dynamics, CFD, weather modeling
- Distributed inference with tensor parallelism across nodes
- AI factory networking backbone
- Scientific computing at national labs and universities

### Hardware Requirements / Compatibility
- Quantum-2 QM9700 Switch: 400Gb/s NDR, 64 ports
- Quantum QM8700 Switch: 200Gb/s HDR, 40 ports (previous gen)
- ConnectX-7 (400Gb/s NDR) or ConnectX-6 (200Gb/s HDR) NICs required
- Compatible with DGX H100, DGX B200, and third-party GPU servers
- UFM management software for fabric topology and health monitoring

### Language Bindings / APIs
- NCCL with InfiniBand SHARP plugin (nccl-ib-sharp) for offloaded collectives
- [[NVIDIA-HPC-X]] with MPI, SHMEM, UCX, UCC, HCOLL, and NCCL-RDMA-SHARP plugin support
- UCX (Unified Communication X) layer
- MPI (OpenMPI, MPICH) over InfiniBand
- OpenSHMEM via NVSHMEM
