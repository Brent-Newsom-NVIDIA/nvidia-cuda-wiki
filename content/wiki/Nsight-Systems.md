## Summary
Nsight Systems is NVIDIA's system-wide performance profiler for GPU-accelerated applications, providing a unified timeline view of CPU, GPU, and memory activity across the entire application. It traces CUDA API calls, kernel launches, memory transfers, OS events, and framework-level operations (PyTorch, TensorFlow) to identify where time is spent at the application level — the starting point before diving into kernel-level optimization with Nsight Compute.

## Detail

### Purpose
Before optimizing individual GPU kernels, developers need to understand the big picture: where is the application spending time? Is it GPU-bound, CPU-bound, or communication-bound? Is data transfer or kernel launch overhead the bottleneck? Nsight Systems provides this application-level view, enabling developers to identify the right kernels and operations to optimize before using Nsight Compute for deep dives.

### Key Features
- System-wide timeline: CPU threads, GPU kernels, memory transfers, CUDA API calls in one view
- Framework-level tracing: PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, TensorRT, DALI, cuDNN annotations
- Multi-GPU support: trace multiple GPUs simultaneously
- Network and communication profiling: NVLink, InfiniBand, NCCL collective operations
- OS-level event tracing: thread scheduling, I/O operations
- Timeline visualization with zoom and filter capabilities
- Report export for sharing and offline analysis
- Command-line interface (nsys) for headless/CI usage
- CPU sampling for identifying hot functions on host
- Supports CUDA, OpenGL, Vulkan, Direct3D APIs
- Cloud and Kubernetes profiling workflows through [[Nsight-Cloud]], including sidecar injection and browser-accessible report viewing.

### Use Cases
- Identifying CPU-GPU synchronization bottlenecks
- Finding idle GPU time due to data starvation
- Profiling NCCL communication overhead in distributed training
- Understanding PyTorch/TensorFlow operator execution timelines
- CI/CD performance regression testing
- End-to-end pipeline optimization (data loading, preprocessing, inference)

### Hardware Requirements
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- All modern NVIDIA GPU architectures supported
- Available on Linux, Windows, and macOS
- CUDA Toolkit or standalone Nsight Systems installation

### Language Bindings
- Command-line tool (nsys) — works on any application
- Python API for automated report analysis
- GUI application (cross-platform)
- NVTX (NVIDIA Tools Extension) API for custom annotations from user code (C, C++, Python, Fortran)
