## Summary
NIM for OpenFold3 is NVIDIA's NIM microservice for all-atom biomolecular complex structure prediction with OpenFold3. It models complexes composed of proteins, DNA, RNA, and ligands, can generate multiple 3D predictions with confidence scores, accepts MSA inputs, and supports structural templates in CIF format.

## Detail
The current docs describe OpenFold3 as a PyTorch implementation of the JAX-based AlphaFold3 direction, extending protein structure prediction to complete biomolecular complexes. NVIDIA's OpenFold3 NIM adds production-oriented tooling: fast GPU inference with optimized CUDA kernels, memory-efficient attention, support for long sequences and large complexes, TensorRT optimization, cuEquivariance kernels, and NIM Telemetry.

OpenFold3 belongs near [[NIM-for-Boltz2]] because both target biomolecular complexes rather than only single-chain protein structure. It belongs near [[cuEquivariance]] because the current docs call out cuEquivariance-accelerated kernels, and near [[TensorRT]] because the NIM includes a TensorRT backend for production inference.
