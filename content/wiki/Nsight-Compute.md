## Summary
Nsight Compute is NVIDIA's next-generation interactive GPU kernel profiler for CUDA applications, providing detailed per-kernel performance metrics, hardware counter data, and guided analysis for identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks. It supports both an interactive GUI and a command-line interface (ncu), and provides roofline analysis, memory throughput breakdowns, and warp execution efficiency metrics to guide kernel optimization.

## Detail

### Purpose
Writing a correct GPU kernel is only half the challenge — writing a fast one requires understanding how the kernel utilizes hardware resources (compute throughput, memory bandwidth, occupancy). Nsight Compute provides the detailed hardware-level data needed to understand why a kernel is slow and what to fix, guiding developers from "it works" to "it runs optimally."

### Key Features
- Interactive kernel profiler with GUI (Nsight Compute IDE) and command-line tool (ncu)
- Nsight Copilot preview in the standalone Nsight Compute 2026.1 download for CUDA-aware profiler guidance
- Detailed hardware performance metrics: compute throughput, memory bandwidth, L1/L2/HBM utilization
- Warp execution efficiency and occupancy analysis
- Roofline performance model visualization
- Source-level attribution: maps performance data back to CUDA source lines and PTX instructions
- Guided analysis with automated bottleneck identification and recommendations
- API debugging: inspect CUDA API calls and their overhead
- Comparison view for before/after optimization analysis
- Multi-GPU and multi-stream profiling
- Supports CUDA 10.0+

### Use Cases
- Identifying memory-bound vs. compute-bound kernel bottlenecks
- Optimizing occupancy and warp efficiency
- Understanding cache hit rates and memory access patterns
- Guided optimization for HPC and deep learning kernels
- Validating performance improvements after code changes
- Performance regression testing

### Hardware Requirements
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (Volta and later for full feature set)
- CUDA Toolkit installed
- Available on Linux, Windows, and macOS (with GUI or CLI)

### Language Bindings
- Command-line tool (ncu) — works on any compiled CUDA binary
- Python API for automated analysis scripting
- GUI application (cross-platform)
