## Summary
NVLM 1.0 is NVIDIA's family of open-source frontier-class multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that achieve performance competitive with GPT-4V and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on vision-language benchmarks. NVLM introduces a novel dual-path architecture (NVLM-D) combining decoder-only cross-attention and an NVLM-H hybrid design, allowing the model to excel at both image understanding and text-only tasks without the regression typical in multimodal fine-tuning. Released in September 2024, NVLM-D 72B is available on Hugging Face.

## Detail

### Purpose
Most multimodal LLMs suffer from a trade-off: adding vision capability degrades text-only performance. NVLM addresses this by designing an architecture that preserves LLM text capabilities while adding high-quality visual understanding, enabling a single model to replace both a specialist LLM and a separate vision model in enterprise pipelines.

### Key Features
- NVLM-D (decoder-only): cross-attention between visual tokens and text decoder; strong OCR, document understanding
- NVLM-H (hybrid): combines cross-attention and interleaved visual tokens; best of both architectures
- NVLM-X (cross-attention only): efficient variant for deployment
- Model sizes: NVLM-D 72B (primary), additional sizes planned
- Dynamic high-resolution image tiling: handles arbitrary aspect ratios and resolutions
- Strong benchmark performance: top results on MMBench, OCRBench, MathVista, DocVQA, AI2D
- Text-only performance preserved: scores competitive with Qwen-72B on pure NLP tasks
- Open weights under NVIDIA Open Model License

### Use Cases
- Document understanding and OCR (invoices, contracts, forms, PDFs)
- Visual question answering for enterprise data
- Chart and table interpretation
- Scientific paper and figure analysis
- Image-grounded customer support and AI assistants
- Multimodal RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) systems

### Hardware Requirements / Compatibility
- NVLM-D 72B: multi-GPU (4x or 8x H100/A100 80GB) with tensor parallelism
- Smaller variants: single A100 80GB

- Available through NIM-style production deployment paths; see [[NIM-for-Vision-Language-Models]] for the current NVIDIA VLM serving docs surface

### Language Bindings / APIs
- Python (Hugging Face Transformers, NeMo framework)
- NVIDIA NIM REST API
- vLLM backend support
- Available on Hugging Face (nvidia/NVLM-D-72B)
