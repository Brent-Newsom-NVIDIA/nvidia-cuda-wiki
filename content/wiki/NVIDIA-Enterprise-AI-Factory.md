## Summary
NVIDIA Enterprise AI Factory is NVIDIA's reference-design concept for building single-tenant, enterprise-ready AI infrastructure with NVIDIA hardware, networking, storage, Kubernetes, and AI Enterprise software. The current design guide frames the AI factory as a co-designed environment for agentic AI, long-running agents, RAG, inference, customization, observability, security, and day-2 operations.

## Detail

### Purpose
An enterprise AI factory industrializes AI deployment inside a company's own infrastructure and partner ecosystem. It combines accelerator capacity, high-speed networking, scalable storage, cloud-native operations, security, and model/application lifecycle software so enterprise teams can run AI as a production capability rather than a collection of prototypes.

### Architecture themes
- NVIDIA accelerated computing with Blackwell-class GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, and high-speed fabrics.
- [[NVIDIA-Enterprise-Reference-Architectures]] translate the strategy into concrete hardware, software, observability, and deployment patterns such as [[NVIDIA-RTX-PRO-AI-Factory]], [[NVIDIA-HGX-AI-Factory]], and [[NVIDIA-NVL72-AI-Factory]].
- [[NVIDIA-AI-Factory-for-Government]] extends the AI factory concept into government, sovereign, FedRAMP High-equivalent, and high-assurance environments.
- [[Red-Hat-AI-Factory-with-NVIDIA]] is the OpenShift AI deployment track for a co-engineered Red Hat/NVIDIA AI factory stack.
- Current and next-generation platform pages extend that map to [[NVIDIA-DGX-BasePOD]], [[NVIDIA-DGX-SuperPOD]], [[NVIDIA-DGX-B300]], [[NVIDIA-GB300-NVL72]], [[NVIDIA-Vera-Rubin]], [[NVIDIA-RTX-PRO-Server]], [[NVIDIA-ConnectX-9]], [[NVIDIA-BlueField-4]], and [[NVIDIA-Silicon-Photonics]].
- [[NVIDIA-BlueField-DPU]] for infrastructure acceleration, zero-trust style isolation, storage, networking, and security offload.
- [[NVIDIA-Spectrum-X]] networking for Ethernet AI factory fabrics and inference latency control.
- [[NVIDIA-Certified-Systems]] and [[NVIDIA-Certified-Storage]] for validated server and storage infrastructure.
- [[NVIDIA-AI-Enterprise]] software, including NIM, NeMo, Dynamo-Triton, GPU Operator, Network Operator, DOCA, DPF, Run:ai, and observability components.
- Kubernetes as the cloud-native control plane for agentic applications, model serving, scheduling, and lifecycle automation.

### Agentic AI factory
The design guide treats agentic AI as a shift from static model serving to long-running, stateful workflows. AI-Q-style agents use routing, persistent context, retrieval, evaluation, tracing, and tool execution. The AI factory becomes the control plane for deploying, monitoring, governing, and improving those agents over time.
