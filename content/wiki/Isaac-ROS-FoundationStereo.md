## Summary
Isaac ROS FoundationStereo is NVIDIA's Isaac ROS support for FoundationStereo, a foundation model for stereo depth estimation. It predicts disparity from stereo RGB image pairs and is useful when a robot needs depth from stereo cameras for mapping, reconstruction, perception, or manipulation.

## Detail

### Purpose
Stereo depth is a core input for mobile robots and manipulation systems. FoundationStereo provides a deep learning approach to disparity estimation that can generalize across scenes, camera types, lighting variation, occlusions, and non-standard camera parameters better than many classical stereo methods.

### Key capabilities
- Stereo disparity prediction from RGB stereo image pairs.
- Transformer-based deep stereo approach trained for broad generalization.
- FoundationStereo v2 support surfaced in current Isaac ROS release notes.
- Isaac ROS package and tutorials for running the model in ROS 2 pipelines.
- Best suited to applications where high-quality depth matters more than strict real-time performance.
- Depth output can feed [[Isaac-ROS-nvblox]] reconstruction, [[NVIDIA-Isaac-for-Mobility]] navigation, and [[NVIDIA-Isaac-for-Manipulation]] obstacle perception.

### NVIDIA context
FoundationStereo sits at the camera-perception edge of Isaac ROS. Its stereo-derived depth can become robot-world geometry through [[Isaac-ROS-nvblox]], which then supports mobile navigation or manipulation planning on [[NVIDIA-Jetson-Platform]] and other NVIDIA GPU systems.
