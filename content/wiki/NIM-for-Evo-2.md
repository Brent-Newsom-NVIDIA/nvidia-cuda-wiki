## Summary
NIM for Evo 2 is NVIDIA's NIM microservice for the Evo 2 biological foundation model. Evo 2 interprets and generates DNA sequences across biological scales, from individual molecules to entire genomes, with sensitivity to single-nucleotide changes for zero-shot predictions and biological system design.

## Detail
The current docs describe Evo 2 as a biological foundation model trained by Arc Institute. NVIDIA's NIM packaging exposes Evo 2 for DNA sequence generation, model forward-pass outputs, benchmarking, model selection, and custom or fine-tuned model checkpoints.

Evo 2 belongs with BioNeMo NIMs, but its query intent is different from structure-prediction pages. [[NIM-for-AlphaFold2]], [[NIM-for-OpenFold3]], and [[NIM-for-Boltz2]] answer structure and interaction questions; Evo 2 answers DNA sequence interpretation/generation, mutation-effect prediction, CRISPR-style design, and synthetic biology questions.
