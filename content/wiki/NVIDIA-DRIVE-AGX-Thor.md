## Summary
NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor is NVIDIA's current DRIVE AGX development platform for production-level autonomous vehicle and AI cockpit development. Public NVIDIA pages describe DRIVE AGX Thor Developer Kit SKUs for bench and in-vehicle development, powered by a Thor SoC with Blackwell-class GPU, Arm Neoverse V3AE CPU, automotive I/O, DriveOS 7.x, DriveWorks, CUDA, TensorRT, NvMedia, and NvStreams. This page consolidates DRIVE AGX Thor hardware/developer-kit information rather than creating separate pages for bench, in-vehicle, or SKU-specific documents.

## Detail

### Purpose
DRIVE AGX Thor gives automotive developers a reference compute platform for testing and building production-oriented AV and in-vehicle AI software. It supports development across perception, sensor fusion, planning, cockpit AI, generative AI, and vehicle integration workflows.

### Key capabilities
- Up to 2,000 FP4 TFLOPS / 1,000 INT8 TOPS class AI performance signal for multiple concurrent AI inference pipelines.
- Production auto-grade silicon orientation with safety and security architecture.
- Automotive I/O including GMSL camera support, Ethernet, CAN, DisplayPort, and vehicle harness/accessory paths.
- DriveOS 7.x software stack with DriveWorks, CUDA, TensorRT, NvMedia, NvStreams, cuDNN, and developer tools.
- Public documentation references DriveOS 7.0.3 Linux SDK docs, release notes, migration guide, API references, TensorRT 10.10.10, and cuDNN 9.7 for DRIVE OS.
- DriveOS LLM SDK and TensorRT 10 integration are public blog signals for low-latency in-vehicle and AV AI development.

### NVIDIA context
DRIVE AGX Thor is the automotive counterpart to [[NVIDIA-Jetson-Thor]]: both bring Thor/Blackwell-era edge AI into physical systems, but DRIVE targets automotive safety, software, sensors, and development-program workflows.
