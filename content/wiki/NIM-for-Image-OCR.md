## Summary
NIM for Image OCR, also called NeMo Retriever OCR, is NVIDIA's OCR microservice for extracting text from images as part of multimodal retrieval pipelines. It is designed to work with [[NIM-for-Object-Detection]] so enterprise documents with tables, charts, infographics, and image-based content can be parsed and connected to RAG applications.

## Detail
The current docs describe NeMo Retriever NIM microservices as building blocks for extraction and retrieval pipelines that parse, process, and connect multimodal data to generative applications. Image OCR NIM extracts text from images, while object detection NIMs identify page elements, table structure, and graphical elements.

OCR is the text extraction step in document-heavy RAG. It turns image regions into text so downstream systems can embed, index, retrieve, rerank, and answer over content that would otherwise be invisible to text-only retrieval. The docs explicitly position OCR alongside Retriever Embedding and Reranking NIMs for pipelines that retrieve across text and other modalities.

This page should be used for questions about NVIDIA OCR in Retriever/NIM workflows, document extraction, or turning visual document content into retrievable text. Use [[NIM-for-Object-Detection]] for layout and visual-region detection and [[NeMo-Retriever-Embedding-NIM]] for embedding/indexing the extracted text.
