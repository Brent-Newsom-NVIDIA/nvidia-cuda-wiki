## Summary
NVIDIA AI Enterprise is a comprehensive, cloud-native AI software platform that provides enterprises with a commercially licensed, enterprise-supported distribution of NVIDIA's full AI stack. It bundles NIM inference microservices, NeMo training and customization tools, Triton Inference Server, RAPIDS accelerated data science, Morpheus cybersecurity AI, and the complete CUDA library ecosystem — all with enterprise SLAs, security patching, and 24x7 support. It serves as the "productized" tier of NVIDIA's developer tools, purpose-built for production, compliance, and regulated environments.
Current DGX product pages also position AI Enterprise as part of the software path for [[NVIDIA-DGX-Spark]], [[NVIDIA-DGX-Station]], [[NVIDIA-DGX-BasePOD]], and DGX data center deployments.

## Detail

### Purpose
While NVIDIA's individual frameworks and libraries are freely available to developers, enterprises running AI in production need a supported, security-scanned, SLA-backed distribution they can rely on for mission-critical workloads. NVIDIA AI Enterprise fills this role: it is NVIDIA's commercial software platform analogous to how Red Hat Enterprise Linux relates to upstream Linux — taking battle-tested open and developer-tier software and wrapping it in the enterprise guarantees (support, CVE patching, compliance certification, roadmap access) required by finance, healthcare, government, and large-scale enterprise customers.

### Key Features
- **Comprehensive Software Bundle:** NIM microservices, NeMo Framework (training, customization, guardrails), Triton Inference Server, TensorRT, RAPIDS (cuDF, cuML, cuGraph), Morpheus (cybersecurity AI), NVIDIA DALI, and the full CUDA math/communication library stack
- **Enterprise SLA & Support:** 24×7 enterprise-grade support with defined severity-based response SLAs; dedicated AI Enterprise support portal and escalation paths
- **Security & CVE Management:** Continuous CVE scanning of all container images; rapid patching cadence; signed containers on NGC — critical for HIPAA, SOC 2, FedRAMP, and GDPR compliance environments
- **NIM Microservices:** Full access to the NIM catalog — LLMs, embedding models, rerankers, vision-language, speech, safety/guardrails, medical imaging, physical AI, weather/climate, visual generation, audio/media enhancement, digital-human animation, biology, chemistry, and atomistic modeling — under enterprise license for on-premises, data-private deployment. Current pages include [[NIM-for-Large-Language-Models]], [[NeMo-Retriever-Embedding-NIM]], [[NeMo-Retriever-Reranking-NIM]], [[NIM-for-Vision-Language-Models]], [[NIM-for-Visual-Generative-AI]], [[NVIDIA-Speech-NIM-Microservices]], [[NIM-for-Maxine-Studio-Voice]], [[NIM-for-Audio2Face-3D]], [[NIM-for-RFdiffusion]], [[NIM-for-DiffDock]], [[NVIDIA-NemoGuard-NIMs]], and [[NIM-for-MAISI]].
- **API and recipe surface:** [[NVIDIA-API-Documentation]] and [[LLM-Inference-Quick-Start-Recipes]] document hosted/self-hosted API patterns for developers moving NVIDIA AI software into applications.
- **NeMo Microservices (NeMo.ms):** Microservice-based LLMOps components: NeMo Curator (data curation), NeMo Customizer (LoRA/SFT/RLHF fine-tuning), NeMo Evaluator, and NeMo Guardrails (content safety)
- **Flexible Licensing:** Licensed via NVIDIA License System (NLS); supports on-premises DGX and certified servers, VMware vSphere with vGPU, Red Hat OpenShift, bare metal, and all major public clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP, OCI Marketplace)
- **NIM Operator:** [[NVIDIA-NIM-Operator]] is the Kubernetes lifecycle manager for NIM and NeMo microservices in production clusters.
- **Run:ai:** current AI Enterprise guidance includes [[NVIDIA-Run-ai]] self-hosted GPU scheduling and workload orchestration; SaaS remains a separate offering
- **AI factory guidance:** current planning docs include [[NVIDIA-Enterprise-AI-Factory]] reference guidance for Blackwell systems, BlueField DPUs, Spectrum-X networking, certified storage, Kubernetes, Run:ai, DOCA, Dynamo-Triton, and AI Enterprise software.
- **Blueprint and agent workflows:** [[NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints]], [[NVIDIA-AI-Q-Blueprint]], and [[NVIDIA-Data-Flywheel-Blueprint]] show how AI Enterprise software components become repeatable agent, retrieval, evaluation, and optimization workflows.
- **AI data layer:** [[NVIDIA-AI-Data-Platform]] and [[NVIDIA-Certified-Storage]] connect AI Enterprise to retrieval, vector search, context, and storage designs for enterprise data.
- **NVIDIA-Certified Systems:** Hardware certification program ensuring server platforms from Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro, etc. are validated and performance-benchmarked for AI Enterprise workloads
- **Software-Defined GPU Partitioning:** Support for MIG (Multi-Instance GPU), vGPU, and [[NVIDIA-Cloud-Native-Technologies]] deployment patterns with enterprise licensing for multi-tenant deployments

### Use Cases
- Enterprise LLM and generative AI deployment with on-premises data privacy and regulatory compliance
- End-to-end LLMOps pipelines: data curation → fine-tuning → evaluation → guardrails → deployment → monitoring
