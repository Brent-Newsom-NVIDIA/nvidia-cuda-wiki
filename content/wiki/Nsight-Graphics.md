## Summary
Nsight Graphics is NVIDIA's standalone developer tool for debugging, profiling, and exporting frames from graphics applications. Current NVIDIA docs list Direct3D 11/12, DirectX Raytracing, Vulkan 1.4, Vulkan Raytracing, OpenGL 4.2-4.6, and OpenVR support, with Windows, Linux, DRIVE OS, and Jetson distribution paths.

## Detail

### Purpose
Nsight Graphics gives graphics and real-time rendering developers frame capture, replay, shader debugging, shader profiling, GPU Trace, crash dump inspection, and API/resource inspection tools. It is the graphics-side Nsight companion to [[Nsight-Systems]] timeline profiling and [[Nsight-Compute]] CUDA kernel profiling.

### Current capabilities
- **Graphics Capture / Graphics Debugger:** captures graphics workloads for frame analysis, replay, object/resource inspection, ray tracing acceleration structure inspection, and offline analysis.
- **GPU Trace:** frame-level profiler for graphics workloads, including RTX workflows, shader performance, hardware events, and frame-time bottleneck analysis.
- **Shader tools:** shader debugger, shader profiler, shader editing, and current cooperative-vector/layer-fusion analysis for neural-rendering-related workflows.
- **Crash analysis:** GPU crash dump inspection through [[Nsight-Aftermath-SDK]] dump viewing in the graphics workflow.
- **Developer interfaces:** current docs include an Nsight Graphics SDK, in beta in 2026.1, for programmatic control of Graphics Capture and GPU Trace activities.
- **Platform/API coverage:** current get-started docs list Windows and Linux downloads; DRIVE OS and JetPack bundle paths; RTX 20/30/40/50-series GeForce GPUs; RTX-series or better Quadro GPUs; D3D11/D3D12/DXR, Vulkan/Vulkan ray tracing, OpenGL, and OpenVR.
- **2026.1 release signals:** current release notes mention leaving captured applications open while debugging, live GPU Trace from Graphics Capture replay, shader profiler support for layer-fusion breakage, and the beta Nsight Graphics SDK.

### NVIDIA context
Nsight Graphics is the primary NVIDIA graphics debugger/profiler for [[NVIDIA-RTX]] rendering and ray tracing applications. It is especially relevant to developers working on DXR/Vulkan ray tracing, RTX Mega Geometry-style workflows, shader performance, neural rendering, and graphics application stability.

NVIDIA also distributes it in automotive and edge stacks: current get-started docs say Nsight Graphics is bundled as part of [[NVIDIA-DriveOS]] for DRIVE AGX development and deployment, and as part of the Jetson development suite in [[NVIDIA-JetPack-SDK]].

## Connections
- [[Nsight-Aftermath-SDK]] - SDK for collecting GPU crash mini-dumps that can be inspected in the graphics debugging workflow.
- [[Nsight-Systems]] - system-level profiler often paired with Nsight Graphics for end-to-end graphics and ray tracing performance analysis.
- [[Nsight-Compute]] - CUDA kernel profiler for compute-heavy graphics, neural rendering, and GPU workloads adjacent to Graphics.
- [[Nsight-Visual-Studio-Edition]] - Visual Studio Nsight integration path on Windows.
- [[NVIDIA-RTX]], [[NVIDIA-DLSS]], [[NVIDIA-Blackwell-Architecture]], and [[NVIDIA-Turing-Architecture]] - graphics/ray tracing hardware and feature context.
- [[NVIDIA-DriveOS]] - current docs say Nsight Graphics is bundled as part of DRIVE OS.
- [[NVIDIA-JetPack-SDK]] and [[NVIDIA-Jetson-Platform]] - current docs say Nsight Graphics is bundled in the Jetson development suite.
- [[NVIDIA-Developer-Program]] - registered developer access, forums, release notes, and bug-reporting context.
- [[NVIDIA-CloudXR]] - adjacent RTX graphics application/streaming workflow where frame/debug/profiling tools matter.
