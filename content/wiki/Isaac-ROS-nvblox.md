## Summary
Isaac ROS nvblox is NVIDIA's ROS 2 integration for GPU-accelerated 3D scene reconstruction, mapping, and navigation costmap generation. It uses depth images and/or 3D LiDAR data to build voxel-based maps, generate meshes, compute distance fields, and output 2D costmaps for robot navigation and planning.

## Detail

### Purpose
Robots need a current model of free space, obstacles, and nearby geometry. Isaac ROS nvblox turns camera or LiDAR observations plus pose estimates into GPU-computed reconstructions that can feed navigation, obstacle avoidance, and manipulation planners.

### Key capabilities
- Real-time local 3D reconstruction from depth cameras, RGB-D cameras, stereo-derived depth, and/or 3D LiDAR.
- TSDF-based voxel mapping for surface reconstruction.
- ESDF distance-field computation for collision checking and path planning.
- 2D costmap output for Nav2-style navigation.
- Mesh visualization and RViz integration for inspecting reconstructions.
- GPU acceleration through the nvblox C++ library, with deployment focus on discrete NVIDIA GPUs and Jetson devices.
- Use in both [[NVIDIA-Isaac-for-Mobility]] navigation and [[NVIDIA-Isaac-for-Manipulation]] obstacle perception.

### NVIDIA context
nvblox is a durable bridge between NVIDIA perception and robot motion. In mobile robots it supports mapping and navigation, while in manipulation it provides obstacle geometry for [[Isaac-ROS-cuMotion]] planning. It is therefore one of the central Isaac ROS pages to query for scene reconstruction.

- [[NVIDIA-Isaac-for-Manipulation]] - uses nvblox for environment and obstacle perception.
- [[Isaac-ROS-Visual-SLAM]] - pose/odometry source that can feed nvblox reconstruction.
- [[Isaac-ROS-Visual-Global-Localization]] - global pose/relocalization path adjacent to mapping and costmaps.
- [[Isaac-ROS-cuMotion]] - can consume reconstructed obstacle representations for collision-aware motion planning.
- [[Isaac-ROS-FoundationStereo]] - stereo-depth source that can feed reconstruction.
- [[Isaac-ROS-NITROS]] - accelerated transport layer for depth, pose, point-cloud, and occupancy-grid data.
- [[NVIDIA-Jetson-Platform]] - edge deployment target for GPU-accelerated robot mapping.
- [[NVIDIA-Isaac-Sim]] - simulation source for depth, pose, and reconstruction tutorials.
- [[NVIDIA-VPI]] - adjacent Jetson vision acceleration layer for camera and stereo processing.
