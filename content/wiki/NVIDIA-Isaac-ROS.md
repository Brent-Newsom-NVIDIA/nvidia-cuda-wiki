## Summary
NVIDIA Isaac ROS is NVIDIA's collection of CUDA-accelerated ROS 2 packages, AI models, and reference workflows for building advanced robotics applications. It brings GPU-accelerated perception, visual SLAM, mapping, localization, manipulation, message transport, and benchmarking into ROS-native robot stacks. Current durable reference workflow pages include [[NVIDIA-Isaac-for-Manipulation]] and [[NVIDIA-Isaac-for-Mobility]], with supporting components such as [[Isaac-ROS-cuMotion]], [[Isaac-ROS-nvblox]], [[Isaac-ROS-FoundationPose]], and [[Isaac-ROS-FoundationStereo]].

## Detail

### Purpose
ROS 2 is the common integration layer for robotics, but high-throughput perception, mapping, and AI inference can bottleneck on CPU-centric data paths. Isaac ROS provides NVIDIA-accelerated packages that keep camera, point-cloud, AI, and geometry data moving efficiently through GPU-enabled ROS graphs.

### Key capabilities
- CUDA-accelerated ROS 2 packages for perception, pose estimation, mapping, localization, visual SLAM, and manipulation.
- NITROS transport patterns for reducing host/device copies and improving intra-graph throughput.
- [[Isaac-ROS-nvblox]], cuVSLAM, visual mapping/localization, and occupancy/costmap workflows for mobile robots.
- [[Isaac-ROS-FoundationPose]] object pose estimation and [[Isaac-ROS-FoundationStereo]] stereo-depth model support.
- [[NVIDIA-Isaac-for-Manipulation]] and [[NVIDIA-Isaac-for-Mobility]] reference workflow areas; earlier docs may call these Isaac Manipulator and Isaac Perceptor.
- [[Isaac-ROS-cuMotion]] GPU-accelerated manipulation planning and robot segmentation.
- Jetson deployment focus, with support for new JetPack and Jetson/Thor platform updates as releases advance.
- Simulation integration with Isaac Sim for testing, validation, and sim-to-real workflows.

### Current release signal
- Isaac ROS 4.3.0 was published on March 23, 2026.
- Recent release notes include Camera-over-Ethernet / SIPL integration, JetPack 7.1 support, DGX Spark and Thor T4000 support signals, FoundationStereo v2 support, updated mapping/localization workflows, and sim-to-real manipulation tutorials.
- Release notes also call out limitations and compatibility details, so exact package choices should be matched to JetPack, Isaac Sim, and hardware version.

### NVIDIA context
Isaac ROS makes NVIDIA acceleration usable inside the ROS 2 ecosystem. It connects [[NVIDIA-Jetson-Platform]] edge compute, [[TensorRT]] optimized inference, [[Triton-Inference-Server]] multi-model serving where needed, [[NVIDIA-Isaac-Sim]] simulation, and [[NVIDIA-DeepStream]]/video analytics style pipelines for real-world robot perception.

## Connections
- [[NVIDIA-Isaac]] - parent robotics platform for Isaac ROS packages and reference workflows.
- [[NVIDIA-Isaac-Sim]] - simulation environment that integrates with ROS 2 and Isaac ROS for hardware-in-the-loop testing.
- [[NVIDIA-Isaac-for-Manipulation]] - current reference architecture for perception-driven robot-arm manipulation.
- [[NVIDIA-Isaac-for-Mobility]] - current reference workflow area continuing Isaac Perceptor for AMR mobility.
- [[Isaac-ROS-cuMotion]] - CUDA-accelerated manipulation planning component.
- [[Isaac-ROS-nvblox]] - GPU-accelerated reconstruction and costmap component.
- [[Isaac-ROS-FoundationPose]] - object pose-estimation component.
- [[Isaac-ROS-FoundationStereo]] - stereo-depth model component.
- [[NVIDIA-Jetson-Platform]] - primary edge deployment hardware family for Isaac ROS robot stacks.
- [[NVIDIA-JetPack-SDK]] - JetPack version compatibility governs Isaac ROS deployment on Jetson.
- [[NVIDIA-Jetson-Thor]] - current physical AI edge platform surfaced in recent Isaac ROS release signals.
- [[TensorRT]] - optimizes perception and AI models used in robotics inference.
- [[Triton-Inference-Server]] - optional serving layer for multi-model robot perception deployments.
- [[NVIDIA-DeepStream]] - adjacent video AI pipeline stack for camera-heavy edge workloads.

## Source Excerpts
