## Summary
NVIDIA Enterprise Reference Architectures are NVIDIA-authored design patterns for building enterprise AI factories from validated compute, networking, storage, software, and operations components. The current docs hub groups the program into hardware reference architectures, software reference architecture guidance, observability, and deployment guides.

## Detail

### Purpose
Enterprise RAs are meant to reduce the risk of building AI infrastructure from scratch. They give partners and enterprise customers prescriptive patterns for GPU node configurations, scalable units, network fabrics, storage expectations, Kubernetes-oriented software, and operational tooling.

### Current RA family
- [[NVIDIA-RTX-PRO-AI-Factory]] for RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition systems using a 2-8-5-200 pattern.
- [[NVIDIA-HGX-AI-Factory]] for HGX B300 systems using a 2-8-9-800 pattern.
- [[NVIDIA-NVL72-AI-Factory]] for GB300 NVL72 rack-scale systems with NVLink domains and Spectrum-X networking.
- [[NVIDIA-AI-Enterprise-Software-Reference-Architecture]] for the common AI Enterprise software stack that runs across supported hardware.
- [[NVIDIA-Enterprise-RA-Observability-Guide]] for dashboarding, alerting, and telemetry across the RA stack.
- [[Red-Hat-AI-Factory-with-NVIDIA]] as the OpenShift-specific AI Enterprise deployment track adjacent to the RA family.
- Application-level Enterprise RA papers are folded into their canonical topic pages, such as [[NVIDIA-Run-ai]], [[NIM-for-Large-Language-Models]], [[NIM-for-LLM-Benchmarking-Guide]], and [[NVIDIA-AI-Q-Blueprint]], rather than creating duplicate paper pages.

### NVIDIA context
This page is the canonical program-level page. It should not absorb every deployment recipe, partner-endorsed design, PDF appendix, or build.nvidia example. Use the specific RA pages for durable NVIDIA-authored architecture documents, and use [[NVIDIA-Enterprise-AI-Factory]] for the broader strategy and planning concept.

## Source Excerpts
- NVIDIA's docs hub says Enterprise RAs are for building AI factories that scale and groups the content into overview, hardware, software, observability, and deployment areas.
- The Enterprise RA overview positions the program as a way to simplify deployment, reduce complexity, and accelerate time to value for enterprise-class AI factory deployments.
