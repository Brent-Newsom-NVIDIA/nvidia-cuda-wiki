## Summary
NeMo Platform is NVIDIA's microservices platform for building and deploying specialized AI agents with open models. It brings together synthetic data generation, model fine-tuning, evaluation, guardrails, inference, RBAC, and observability.

## Detail

### Purpose
Agentic AI systems need more than a model endpoint: they need data creation, customization, evaluation, guardrails, deployment, and governance. NeMo Platform provides an integrated microservices layer for those lifecycle steps.

### Key capabilities
- Synthetic training data generation.
- Model fine-tuning and customization.
- Model and agent evaluation.
- Security testing and real-time protection with guardrails.
- Self-hosted [[NVIDIA-NemoGuard-NIMs]] deployment through the inference gateway for content safety, topic control, and jailbreak detection.
- Unified inference gateway and NIM integration.
- Workspaces, projects, entities, RBAC, and observability for platform operations.
- Local quickstart and Kubernetes deployment paths.

### NVIDIA context
NeMo Platform is the operational/microservices side of [[NVIDIA-NeMo]], whereas NeMo Framework is the open-source training/development framework. It should be linked from pages about NIM, Retriever, Guardrails, agent workflows, AI blueprints, and data flywheel optimization.

## Connections
- [[NVIDIA-NeMo]] - parent suite for agent lifecycle management.
- [[NVIDIA-NIM]] - inference microservices and hosted NIM targets.
- [[NeMo-Retriever]] - retrieval services for enterprise RAG and multimodal extraction.
- [[NeMo-Guardrails]] - real-time protection and policy enforcement.
- [[NVIDIA-NemoGuard-NIMs]] - specialized NIMs deployed through NeMo Platform for guardrail use cases.
- [[Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-8B-NIM]], [[Llama-3.1-NemoGuard-8B-TopicControl-NIM]], and [[NVIDIA-NemoGuard-JailbreakDetect-NIM]] - representative guardrail NIM deployments.
- [[NVIDIA-Agent-Intelligence-Toolkit]] - workflow layer for building and optimizing agents.
- [[NVIDIA-AI-Q-Blueprint]] - blueprint that uses NeMo Agent Toolkit concepts with retrieval, evaluation, and deployment.
- [[NVIDIA-Data-Flywheel-Blueprint]] - blueprint that uses NeMo Customizer, Evaluator, Datastore, Deployment Manager, Entity Store, and NIM Proxy.
- [[NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints]] - catalog where NeMo microservices appear in current NVIDIA-authored application workflows.
