## Summary
Nemotron 3 Super is NVIDIA's open 120B-total, 12B-active reasoning LLM for complex agentic workloads, long-context reasoning, coding, planning, tool use, and collaborative multi-agent systems. NVIDIA positions it as the higher-capacity member of the Nemotron 3 family, complementary to [[Nemotron-3-Nano]] for targeted execution and [[Nemotron-3-Nano-Omni]] for omnimodal perception.

## Detail

### Purpose
Nemotron 3 Super targets the high-capacity side of agentic AI: tasks where the model must sustain long context, reason over code or retrieved documents, plan across tool calls, and avoid goal drift over multi-step workflows. NVIDIA's launch material frames Super as a way to reduce the "thinking tax" in multi-agent systems by using an efficient MoE architecture rather than sending every task to a dense frontier-scale model.

### Model profile
- Total parameters: 120B.
- Active parameters: 12B.
- Context window: up to 1M tokens in NVIDIA's public model material and Nemotron usage docs.
- Architecture: hybrid Mamba-Transformer / latent mixture-of-experts design with Mamba-2 layers, MoE layers, selective attention layers, and Multi-Token Prediction.
- NVIDIA reports open weights, datasets, training recipes, deployment cookbooks, fine-tuning cookbooks, and evaluation recipes around the model.
- The model is distributed through build.nvidia.com and Hugging Face, and NVIDIA describes it as packaged as [[NVIDIA-NIM]].

### Training and tooling
NVIDIA's technical blog says Super was pretrained on 25T tokens, underwent supervised fine-tuning over a larger post-training corpus, and was post-trained with multi-environment reinforcement learning using [[NeMo-RL]] and NeMo Gym. The same material points to [[NeMo-Data-Designer]], [[NeMo-Evaluator]], and open recipes for reproducibility.

[[NeMo-Megatron-Bridge]] has a current Nemotron 3 Super page for Hugging Face/Megatron conversion, pretraining examples, full-parameter fine-tuning, LoRA, PTQ/QAT quantization, and exporting quantized checkpoints back to Hugging Face. Current Bridge docs call out B200/NVFP4-oriented training paths and expert-parallel MoE settings for large-scale work.

[[Nemotron-Training-Recipes]] adds the public cookbook layer: Stage 0 pretraining with diversity, quality, and long-context phases; Stage 1 SFT with a two-stage output-loss procedure and continued MTP training; Stage 2 RL with multi-environment RLVR, SWE-RL, and RLHF; plus evaluation and FP8/NVFP4 quantization surfaces.

### Agent and coding workflows
The Nemotron usage cookbook includes a current "Nemotron 3 Super with Agentic Coding Tools" page. It shows Super with agentic coding tools such as OpenCode, OpenClaw, Kilo Code CLI, and OpenHands through OpenRouter/build.nvidia.com-style access. The page uses model references such as `nvidia/nemotron-3-super` and `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b`, with a 1M context and large output-token limits in examples.

Use this page for the Super reasoning model. Use [[Nemotron-3-Nano]] for the smaller text-only Nemotron 3 reasoning model, [[Nemotron-3-Nano-Omni]] for the omnimodal VLM/audio/video model, [[Nemotron]] for the full family, and [[NIM-for-Large-Language-Models]] for the generic LLM NIM serving surface.
