## Summary
NVIDIA HPC-X is NVIDIA's communications toolkit for high-performance MPI, SHMEM, and PGAS applications on NVIDIA networking. The current docs line is HPC-X Rev 2.26, tested as part of Spectrum-X reference architecture 2.1, and includes MPI, OpenSHMEM, UCX, UCC, HCOLL, ClusterKit, NCCL-RDMA-SHARP plugins, multi-GPU support, and Spectrum-X NCCL plugin guidance. It is the main NVIDIA networking software bridge between traditional HPC communication models and GPU-heavy AI/HPC clusters.

## Detail
HPC-X packages and optimizes the communications libraries that many HPC and AI applications rely on. NVIDIA describes it as a comprehensive software package including MPI and SHMEM communications libraries plus acceleration packages that improve performance and scalability.

The toolkit includes HPC-X MPI, an optimized Open MPI implementation; HPC-X OpenSHMEM for one-sided communication; Unified Communication X (UCX) for low-overhead point-to-point communication; Unified Collective Communication (UCC) for collectives; HCOLL for collective acceleration; ClusterKit for cluster health and performance assessment; and NCCL-RDMA-SHARP plugins that integrate NVIDIA collective communication with RDMA and SHARP.

HPC-X is adjacent to, but distinct from, [[NCCL]] and [[NVSHMEM]]. NCCL is the deep-learning collective library, NVSHMEM is a GPU-cluster PGAS programming model, and HPC-X provides the broader MPI/SHMEM/UCX/UCC toolkit used by HPC applications and cluster validation. All three depend on the same NVIDIA fabric strengths: [[NVIDIA-Quantum-InfiniBand]], [[NVIDIA-ConnectX-InfiniBand]], [[GPUDirect-RDMA]], SHARP, and increasingly [[NVIDIA-Spectrum-X]] for Ethernet AI networking. On hosts, the relevant NVIDIA driver substrate is now [[NVIDIA-DOCA-OFED]], with [[NVIDIA-MLNX-OFED]] remaining important for legacy LTS deployments.
