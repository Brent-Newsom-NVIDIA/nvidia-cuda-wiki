## Summary
NVIDIA BlueField-4 is the next-generation DPU in NVIDIA's BlueField family, positioned for AI factory infrastructure, AI-native storage, context memory, security, networking, and offload. Current public NVIDIA pages connect BlueField-4 directly to [[NVIDIA-STX]] and [[NVIDIA-CMX]] designs for storage/context processing.

## Detail

### Purpose
BlueField-4 extends the BlueField DPU role from host networking and infrastructure offload into AI-native data infrastructure. In NVIDIA's latest public material it appears as a storage/context processor that can manage NVMe, integrity, encryption, key-value cache, and low-latency access paths for agentic AI workloads.

### Current public positioning
- DPU generation following BlueField-3.
- Used in [[NVIDIA-STX]] AI-native storage reference architecture.
- Used in [[NVIDIA-CMX]] context memory storage platform.
- Works with [[NVIDIA-DOCA]] software and DOCA Memos for context/KV-cache workflows.
- Fits [[NVIDIA-AI-Data-Platform]] and [[NVIDIA-Enterprise-AI-Factory]] designs where storage, security, networking, and compute are co-designed.

### NVIDIA context
Use [[NVIDIA-BlueField-DPU]] as the family-level page. Use this page when the current generation matters: STX, CMX, BlueField-4-powered storage, context memory, AI data platforms, and future rack-scale AI factory networking.
