## Summary
Isaac ROS DNN Inference is NVIDIA's ROS 2 package family for running deep neural network inference inside robot perception graphs. It provides image-to-tensor encoding, TensorRT and Triton inference nodes, tensor post-processing, and model-specific decoder paths for object detection, segmentation, stereo depth, and pose estimation.

## Detail

### Purpose
Robot perception graphs usually turn sensor streams into tensors, run an optimized model, then decode tensors into detections, masks, depth, poses, or other semantic outputs. Isaac ROS DNN Inference provides the ROS 2 infrastructure for that encoder/inference/decoder pattern on NVIDIA GPUs.

### Key capabilities
- DNN image encoder utilities for converting image inputs into model-ready tensors.
- TensorRT node for high-performance local inference on Jetson and discrete NVIDIA GPUs.
- Triton node for serving models through [[Triton-Inference-Server]] backends such as TensorRT, ONNX Runtime, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
- Tensor processing utilities and model-specific decoder integration.
- Robotics perception package support for object detection, image segmentation, stereo depth, and 3D pose estimation.
- NITROS acceleration for optimized message formats and graph communication.
- NGC pre-trained model usage and fine-tuning/deployment paths for robotics perception models.

### NVIDIA context
Isaac ROS DNN Inference is the bridge between NVIDIA inference platforms and ROS 2 robot software. It connects [[TensorRT]], [[Triton-Inference-Server]], [[Isaac-ROS-NITROS]], [[NVIDIA-Jetson-Platform]], and higher-level perception packages such as [[Isaac-ROS-Object-Detection]], [[Isaac-ROS-FoundationPose]], and [[Isaac-ROS-FoundationStereo]].
