## Summary
NVIDIA Quantum is NVIDIA's accelerated quantum computing platform area. It frames useful quantum computing as a hybrid system problem: quantum processing units need to be integrated with AI supercomputers, GPU acceleration, realtime control, simulation, and programming tools. The current NVIDIA Quantum page centers [[NVIDIA-NVQLink]], [[CUDA-Q]], [[CUDA-QX]], [[cuQuantum]], [[cuPQC]], [[NVIDIA-Quantum-Cloud]], and the [[NVIDIA-Accelerated-Quantum-Center]] as the main current solution surfaces.

## Detail

### Purpose
NVIDIA Quantum exists because practical quantum computing is not only a QPU problem. Useful quantum systems require classical supercomputing for simulation, calibration, quantum error correction, hybrid algorithms, and realtime feedback loops. NVIDIA's position is that QPUs should be coupled to GPU-accelerated AI/HPC systems through CUDA-Q software, NVQLink realtime integration, and quantum-specific libraries.
