## Summary
NVIDIA BioNeMo is a platform of GPU-accelerated AI models and frameworks purpose-built for computational biology, drug discovery, and life sciences research. Current NVIDIA docs split the ecosystem between BioNeMo Framework for model training/customization, [[BioNeMo-Recipes]] for public reference implementations, and BioNeMo NIMs for deployable inference microservices. BioNeMo enables pharmaceutical companies and research institutions to accelerate hit identification, lead optimization, sequence design, genomics, and structure or docking workflows using NVIDIA GPUs.

## Detail

### Purpose
Computational biology and drug discovery involve computationally intensive tasks: predicting how proteins fold, generating candidate drug molecules, screening billions of compound-target interactions, and analyzing genomic sequences. These workflows traditionally take days to weeks on CPU clusters. BioNeMo re-engineers these pipelines with GPU-accelerated foundation models, reducing protein structure predictions from hours (CPU AlphaFold2) to seconds, and enabling generative molecular design at scale.

### Key Features
- **Pre-Trained Biomolecular Models:** BioNeMo Framework docs currently list AMPLIFY, ESM-2, Evo2, and Geneformer as available models, while BioNeMo NIM docs expose additional deployable biology, chemistry, and atomistic modeling services.
  - **AMPLIFY / ESM-2 / Geneformer:** third-party-origin biological models integrated or optimized in BioNeMo Framework and [[BioNeMo-Recipes]] for representation learning and training examples.
  - **Evo2:** DNA foundation-model workflows represented both in BioNeMo Framework docs and [[NIM-for-Evo-2]].
  - **[[NIM-for-AlphaFold2]] / [[NIM-for-AlphaFold2-Multimer]]:** NVIDIA NIMs for single-chain and multimer AlphaFold2 protein structure prediction, with MSA workflows.
  - **[[NIM-for-OpenFold2]] / [[NIM-for-OpenFold3]]:** OpenFold protein and biomolecular-complex structure prediction NIMs; OpenFold3 covers proteins, DNA, RNA, ligands, structural templates, TensorRT, and cuEquivariance acceleration.
  - **[[NIM-for-Boltz2]]:** biomolecular structure and binding-affinity prediction NIM for proteins, RNA, DNA, ligands, and constrained molecular interactions.
  - **[[NIM-for-Evo-2]]:** DNA sequence interpretation and generation NIM for biological foundation-model workflows.
  - **[[NIM-for-MSA-Search]]:** GPU-accelerated MSA, paired MSA, and structural template search for structure-prediction pipelines.
  - **[[NIM-for-RFdiffusion]] / [[NIM-for-ProteinMPNN]]:** protein structure generation and sequence-design NIMs that can be chained for binder/scaffold workflows.
  - **[[NIM-for-MolMIM]] / [[NIM-for-GenMol]]:** controlled and fragment-based small molecule generation NIMs.
  - **[[NIM-for-DiffDock]]:** diffusion-based molecular docking NIM for protein-ligand pose prediction.
  - **[[NIM-for-ALCHEMI-Batched-Geometry-Relaxation]] / [[NIM-for-ALCHEMI-Batched-Molecular-Dynamics]]:** ALCHEMI atomistic modeling NIMs for relaxation and molecular dynamics using MLIPs.
  - **Single-cell and genomics models:** Geneformer and Evo2 cover single-cell representation and DNA sequence interpretation/generation workflows.
- **BioNeMo Framework:** Python tooling, packages, models, datasets, and APIs for building, training, fine-tuning, and integrating biomolecular AI models.
- **[[BioNeMo-Recipes]]:** current public reference-code layer for TransformerEngine-accelerated biological foundation model training with [[PyTorch]], [[Hugging-Face-Accelerate]], FSDP2, megatron-FSDP, BF16/FP8/MXFP8, and self-contained Docker recipes.
- **Current framework docs:** latest docs are being refactored as NVIDIA consolidates earlier 5D parallelism training code with BioNeMo Recipes; the wiki keeps recipe-level material in [[BioNeMo-Recipes]] and NIM inference material in the relevant NIM pages.
- **NIM Deployment:** All BioNeMo models are packaged as NIM microservices — deploy via `docker run`, call via REST API — integrating seamlessly into existing computational biology pipelines
- **Virtual Screening Pipelines:** End-to-end GPU-accelerated pipelines combining structure prediction, docking, ADMET property filtering, and generative design
- **cuEquivariance Integration:** GPU-accelerated equivariant operations (SO(3)/SE(3) symmetry) used in BioNeMo's structure-aware models for 10× speedup over CPU implementations
- **NVIDIA AI Enterprise Licensed:** Enterprise support, security patching, and SLA available for pharmaceutical production deployments

### Use Cases
- **Protein Structure Prediction:** Rapid prediction of 3D protein structures for novel targets and mutant variants
- **Virtual Screening:** GPU-accelerated docking of million-compound libraries against protein targets in hours
- **Generative Molecule Design:** De novo drug candidate generation using MolMIM or diffusion models, constrained by binding site or ADMET properties
- **Protein Engineering:** Sequence design for antibodies, enzymes, and therapeutic proteins using ProteinMPNN
- **Protein design pipelines:** generate structures with [[NIM-for-RFdiffusion]], design sequences with [[NIM-for-ProteinMPNN]], and validate or refine with structure-prediction NIMs.
- **MSA and template preprocessing:** use [[NIM-for-MSA-Search]] to feed AlphaFold/OpenFold/Boltz workflows.
- **Atomistic simulation:** use ALCHEMI BGR/BMD NIMs for geometry relaxation and molecular dynamics with MLIP models.
- **Biological model training:** adapt or scale AMPLIFY, ESM-2, Geneformer, Evo2, and similar biological foundation model workflows through BioNeMo Framework and [[BioNeMo-Recipes]].
