## Summary
NVIDIA NIM for Multimodal Safety provides prebuilt NIM containers for multimodal safety models used to safeguard AI applications that understand or generate multimodal content. Current docs describe CUDA-accelerated containers, TensorRT/Triton-backed high-performance inference, and use cases such as AI-generated image detection and deepfake image detection.

## Detail

### Purpose
Multimodal applications need safety checks for generated and uploaded visual content, not only text. NIM for Multimodal Safety provides a deployment path for content-moderation models that can sit next to VLM, visual generation, retrieval, and agent workflows.

### Current scope
- Prebuilt containers for multimodal safety models.
- CUDA-accelerated runtime for NVIDIA GPUs with optimized profiles for many configurations.
- Triton-accelerated container architecture.
- Model artifact download/cache behavior and container security scan reports.
- Applications include AI-generated image detection, social media moderation, phishing/deepfake detection, art/authenticity verification, and broader content moderation scenarios.

### NVIDIA context
This page complements text-oriented [[NVIDIA-NemoGuard-NIMs]] by covering visual/multimodal moderation. It is especially relevant near [[NIM-for-Vision-Language-Models]], [[NIM-for-Visual-Generative-AI]], and multimodal retrieval/extraction NIMs.

## Connections

- [[NIM-for-Visual-Generative-AI]] - image generation/editing workflows that may need moderation.
- [[NIM-for-Image-OCR]] and [[NIM-for-Object-Detection]] - visual extraction NIMs adjacent to multimodal moderation.
- [[NVIDIA-NemoGuard-NIMs]] and [[NeMo-Guardrails]] - text/LLM guardrail companions.
- [[TensorRT]] and [[Triton-Inference-Server]] - acceleration and serving stack named in current docs.
- [[NVIDIA-AI-Enterprise]] - enterprise deployment/support context.

## Source Excerpts
- NVIDIA docs describe Multimodal Safety NIMs as prebuilt containers for safeguarding AI applications that understand and generate multimodal content.
- The docs state that Multimodal Safety NIM containers are accelerated with Triton Inference Server and use CUDA-accelerated runtimes.
