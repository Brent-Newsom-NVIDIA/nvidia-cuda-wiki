## Summary
NVIDIA HGX is a high-performance multi-GPU baseboard platform designed for AI training, inference, and HPC in data center servers. It connects 8 GPUs via NVLink in an SXM form factor, enabling OEM and ODM server builders to create NVIDIA-validated AI compute nodes. The platform spans multiple GPU generations including Blackwell (B200, B300) and Rubin.

## Detail

### Purpose
Provides a standardized, NVIDIA-validated multi-GPU baseboard that OEMs and ODMs use to build GPU-accelerated servers. Unlike DGX (NVIDIA's complete turnkey system), HGX is the GPU board that goes into third-party server designs.

### Current Configurations

| System | GPU Gen | NVLink Gen | GPU-to-GPU BW | Total NVLink BW | Total Memory |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HGX Rubin NVL8 | Rubin | 6th Gen | 3.6 TB/s | 28.8 TB/s | 2.3 TB |
| HGX B300 | Blackwell Ultra | 5th Gen | 1.8 TB/s | 14.4 TB/s | 2.1 TB |
| HGX B200 | Blackwell | 5th Gen | 1.8 TB/s | 14.4 TB/s | 1.4 TB |

### Key Features
- 8x SXM GPU form factor per baseboard
- Fifth/sixth-generation NVLink for all-to-all GPU communication
- Optional NVIDIA Vera CPU or x86-based CPU baseboard pairing
- Advanced networking: up to 800 Gb/s (Quantum-X800 InfiniBand or Spectrum-X Ethernet)
- NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPU integration for networking and security services
- Validated reference designs for major server OEMs (Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro, etc.)

### Performance (HGX Rubin NVL8 vs HGX B200)
- **5.5x** more NVFP4 inference performance
- **3.5x** higher inference performance vs. prior generation
- **2.6x** higher LLM training performance
- **2x** attention (transformer) performance improvement
- Current public materials connect HGX B300 and HGX Rubin NVL8 to Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin platform roadmaps rather than requiring separate wiki pages for every HGX baseboard variant.
- The current [[NVIDIA-HGX-AI-Factory]] Enterprise RA turns HGX B300 into a 2-8-9-800 AI factory pattern with Spectrum-X, ConnectX-8, BlueField-3, AI Enterprise, Run:ai, and NetQ.

### Use Cases
- Large language model training (up to multi-node scale)
- Generative AI inference
- High-performance computing and simulation
- Enterprise AI at scale

### Target Customers
OEM server builders (Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro, etc.) and their data center customers who want NVIDIA-validated GPU compute in their own server chassis and management ecosystem.

### Relationship to DGX
HGX is the GPU baseboard; DGX is NVIDIA's complete turnkey system built around the same GPU technology. HGX gives OEMs flexibility on chassis, cooling, and management software.
