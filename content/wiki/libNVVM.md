## Summary
libNVVM is an NVIDIA compiler library that accepts NVVM IR (an LLVM-based intermediate representation) as input and compiles it to PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) assembly for NVIDIA GPUs. It is the compiler backend used by NVIDIA to implement GPU-targeting compilers for languages other than CUDA C/C++ — notably the NVPTX backend in LLVM/Clang is used in combination with libNVVM, and it is the compilation pathway for CUDA Fortran, OpenACC, and OpenCL on NVIDIA GPUs. libNVVM enables third-party language compilers to generate optimized NVIDIA GPU code without reimplementing GPU-specific optimizations.

## Detail

### Purpose
libNVVM provides compiler and language tool developers with a stable API to the NVIDIA GPU compiler backend. Rather than implementing GPU code generation from scratch, a language compiler can lower its IR to NVVM IR (a subset of LLVM IR with CUDA-specific intrinsics) and hand off to libNVVM for PTX generation. This is how CUDA Fortran (PGI/NVIDIA HPC SDK), Julia's GPU compiler, and various research language compilers target NVIDIA GPUs.

### Key Features
- Accepts NVVM IR (LLVM-based IR with NVIDIA extensions) as input bitcode
- Outputs PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) assembly targeting specified `sm_XX` architecture
- Architecture targeting: supports all CUDA compute capabilities
- Optimization: performs GPU-specific optimizations during PTX generation
- Debug info support: generates PTX with debug information for CUDA-GDB
- Intrinsic support: CUDA-specific intrinsics (warp shuffles, memory fences, special registers)
- `nvvmCreateProgram`, `nvvmAddModuleToProgram`, `nvvmCompileProgram` API
- Error and info log retrieval for diagnostics
- Link-time optimization at the NVVM IR level
- Used internally by NVCC's device compilation pipeline

### Use Cases
- Building GPU-targeting compilers for new or existing programming languages
- Implementing OpenACC/OpenMP GPU offload in HPC compilers (NVIDIA HPC SDK)
- Julia GPU compiler backend (CUDA.jl uses LLVM's NVPTX backend + libNVVM)
- Python JIT compilers targeting NVIDIA GPUs (Numba's CUDA JIT)
- Research language compilers and DSLs for GPU computing
- Implementing GPU backends for functional languages

### Hardware Requirements
- No GPU hardware required for compilation itself (compilation is CPU-side)
- Generated PTX executes on NVIDIA GPU with appropriate Compute Capability
- Typically bundled with CUDA Toolkit installation

### Language Bindings
- C (primary API)
- C++ (common usage)
- Available to any language with C FFI capability (Python via ctypes, Julia, Rust, etc.)

## Connections
- [[NVRTC]] — NVRTC provides a higher-level runtime compilation API that internally uses libNVVM for code generation
- [[NVCC]] — NVCC's device-side compilation pipeline uses libNVVM as a core compilation step
- [[nvJitLink]] — nvJitLink links the PTX/cubin output produced by libNVVM for runtime linking
- [[CUDA-GDB]] — debugging code compiled via libNVVM uses CUDA-GDB with PTX-level debugging
