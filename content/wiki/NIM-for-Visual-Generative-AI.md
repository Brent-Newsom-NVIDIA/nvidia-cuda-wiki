## Summary
NVIDIA NIM for Visual Generative AI is the NIM microservice family for running visual generative AI models with NVIDIA-optimized deployment. Current docs describe image generation from text, enterprise-ready inference features, NGC model download/cache behavior, TensorRT/Triton acceleration, and supported model families such as FLUX, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and TRELLIS.

## Detail

### Purpose
Visual generative AI NIMs let teams deploy image generation, image editing, and 3D asset generation models behind production APIs without rebuilding the inference serving stack. They are distinct from [[NIM-for-Cosmos-WFM]], which focuses on physical AI world foundation models and video/world generation.

### Current scope
- Text-to-image generation.
- Image editing and in-context image generation workflows.
- Supported model families in current docs include FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, FLUX.1-schnell, FLUX.2-klein, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and TRELLIS.
- NIM containers that download model artifacts from NGC and use local caching to reduce startup time.
- NVIDIA-produced model profiles optimized for common data center GPUs, with custom optimization paths when profiles are not provided.
- Enterprise features covering high performance, scalability, security scanning, observability, air-gapped deployment, and OpenAI-compatible image generation/editing APIs.

### NVIDIA context
Visual GenAI NIMs are part of the broader [[NVIDIA-NIM]] catalog and complement VLM, Cosmos, Retriever, and LLM NIMs. They connect creative/model-generation workloads to the same enterprise inference stack used by [[NVIDIA-AI-Enterprise]], [[TensorRT]], and [[Triton-Inference-Server]].

## Connections
- [[NVIDIA-NIM]] - umbrella inference microservices platform.
- [[NIM-for-Vision-Language-Models]] - companion multimodal understanding NIM family.
- [[NIM-for-Cosmos-WFM]] - physical AI world model NIM family, separate from general visual generation.
- [[NIM-for-Cosmos-Embed1]] - video-text embedding NIM for search and curation around visual datasets.
- [[NVIDIA-Cosmos]] - broader world foundation model platform for physical AI.
- [[NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints]] - application workflows can compose generation, retrieval, and reasoning NIMs.
- [[NVIDIA-AI-Enterprise]] - enterprise deployment and support context.
- [[NVIDIA-NGC-Catalog]] - model and container distribution path.
- [[TensorRT]] and [[Triton-Inference-Server]] - NVIDIA inference acceleration and serving stack.

## Source Excerpts
- NVIDIA docs describe Visual Generative AI NIM as a way to run popular visual generative AI models optimally.
- The docs list high performance, scalable deployment, enterprise-grade security, model-profile support, and OpenAI-compatible APIs as part of the current surface.
