## Summary
NVIDIA Jetson is the embedded AI computing platform for robots, autonomous machines, intelligent cameras, industrial systems, and physical AI devices. It combines NVIDIA GPUs, Arm CPUs, accelerators, video/camera hardware, high-speed I/O, [[NVIDIA-JetPack-SDK]], and [[NVIDIA-Jetson-Linux]] into production modules and developer kits. Current NVIDIA public material positions [[NVIDIA-Jetson-Thor]] as the Blackwell-generation physical AI platform while Jetson Orin remains the broad production family for many JetPack 6 deployments.

## Detail

### Purpose
AI inference workloads are increasingly needed at the edge — in robots, cameras, drones, industrial machines, and embedded devices — where cloud connectivity is unreliable, latency is critical, or data privacy prevents cloud offload. Jetson provides the compute density to run complex neural networks locally, from compact Orin deployments to Thor-class physical AI systems, with the same CUDA/TensorRT programming model used in data centers.

### Key Features

**Current and major Jetson families:**
- **[[NVIDIA-Jetson-Thor]] / Jetson T5000 and T4000:** Blackwell-generation physical AI modules for humanoid robotics, high-end edge AI, and real-time multimodal workloads.
- **Jetson Orin Nano (4/8 GB):** 20–40 TOPS AI performance; 5–10W; lowest-cost Orin for volume edge deployments
- **Jetson Orin NX (8/16 GB):** 70–100 TOPS; 10–20W; mid-range performance for smart cameras and compact robots
- **Jetson AGX Orin (32/64 GB):** 200–275 TOPS; 15–60W; top-tier Orin for autonomous machines and industrial robots
- **Jetson AGX Orin Industrial:** Industrial temperature range (-40°C to 85°C), extended lifetime supply for mission-critical deployments

**Previous Generation (still deployed):**
- **Jetson Xavier NX / AGX Xavier:** 15–32 TOPS; previous-gen for existing robot fleets
- **Jetson Nano / TX2:** Legacy; suitable for lightweight inference tasks

**Key hardware/software features:**
- **NVIDIA GPU cores:** Ampere-class GPU on Orin and Blackwell-generation GPU on Jetson Thor for CUDA, TensorRT, graphics, and generative AI workloads.
- **DLA / accelerators:** DLA on supported Orin/Xavier platforms and newer Thor-era accelerators for power-efficient perception and AI pipelines.
- **PVA (Programmable Vision Accelerator):** signal processing and computer vision operations; VPI 4.0 highlights PVA as part of Thor/Orin vision acceleration.
- **NVDEC/NVENC:** Hardware video decode (H.264/H.265/VP9/AV1) and encode for camera pipelines
- **MIG on Thor:** Multi-Instance GPU style partitioning for isolated mixed-criticality robot workloads.
- **JetPack SDK:** [[NVIDIA-JetPack-SDK]] bundles Jetson Linux, CUDA-X, TensorRT, cuDNN, VPI, DeepStream, samples, tools, and documentation.
- **Jetson Linux:** [[NVIDIA-Jetson-Linux]] provides the kernel, bootloader, drivers, firmware, flashing, root filesystem, and BSP layer.
- **VPI:** [[NVIDIA-VPI]] exposes CPU, CUDA, PVA, VIC, and OFA-backed computer vision/image processing algorithms where supported.
- **JPS:** [[NVIDIA-Jetson-Platform-Services]] provides modular edge AI services for video analytics, VLM, detection, storage, and APIs.

### Use Cases
- Mobile robots and AMRs (Autonomous Mobile Robots): real-time navigation, obstacle avoidance, and manipulation planning
- Intelligent cameras (IPC): local AI inference for retail analytics, security, and smart city without cloud dependency
- Industrial inspection: real-time defect detection on assembly lines at camera-side
- Drones: onboard perception for autonomous flight, mapping, and inspection
- Medical devices: bedside AI diagnostics and real-time imaging analysis
- Agricultural robotics: crop counting, disease detection, precision spraying with onboard AI
- Smart NVRs and edge video analytics with DeepStream for multi-camera processing

### Hardware Requirements / Compatibility
- **Carrier boards:** NVIDIA developer kits use reference carriers; production modules require customer or partner carrier-board integration.
- **JetPack 7 / Jetson Linux 38.x:** current Thor-focused stack using Ubuntu 24.04/kernel 6.8-era direction in NVIDIA public docs.
- **JetPack 6 / Jetson Linux 36.x:** production Jetson Orin stack; Jetson Linux 38.4 docs explicitly direct Orin users to 36.4.4.
- **JetPack 5:** sustaining mode for Jetson Orin/Xavier families.
- **Power:** ranges from low-power Orin Nano/NX deployments through Thor-class 40-130W physical AI systems.

### Language Bindings / APIs
- **CUDA C/C++:** Full CUDA programming support with hardware-matched toolkit in [[NVIDIA-JetPack-SDK]]
- **Python:** CuPy, PyTorch (NVIDIA-built Jetson wheel), TensorRT Python API, DeepStream Python bindings
- **TensorRT:** Primary inference optimization tool; generates DLA-compatible engine files for hardware accelerator
- **ROS 2 / Isaac ROS:** NVIDIA-accelerated ROS 2 hardware-accelerated nodes (cuVS, Visual SLAM, nvblox) via [[NVIDIA-Isaac-ROS]]
- **Triton:** Triton Inference Server runs on Jetson for local multi-model serving
- **GStreamer:** DeepStream pipelines run natively on Jetson with NVDEC/NVENC hardware acceleration
