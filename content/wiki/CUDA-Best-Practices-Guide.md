## Summary
The CUDA Best Practices Guide is NVIDIA's practical guide for writing high-performance CUDA applications. It covers profiling, APOD optimization workflow, correctness, numerical precision, memory optimization, execution configuration, instruction optimization, deployment, and compatibility.

## Detail
The guide is the performance companion to [[CUDA-Programming-Guide]]. It emphasizes an assess, parallelize, optimize, deploy cycle and links CUDA optimization decisions to profiling tools such as [[Nsight-Systems]] and [[Nsight-Compute]].

It is also a good canonical page for deployment-oriented questions that cross between performance, compatibility, testing, and CUDA library redistribution.
Architecture-specific tuning pages such as [[CUDA-Blackwell-Tuning-Guide]], [[CUDA-Hopper-Tuning-Guide]], and [[CUDA-Ampere-Tuning-Guide]] should be used when the performance question depends on a GPU generation.
