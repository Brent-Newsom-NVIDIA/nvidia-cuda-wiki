## Summary
NVIDIA Run:ai is NVIDIA's AI workload and GPU orchestration platform for running AI workloads across the AI lifecycle. It manages GPU allocation, workload scheduling, policy, quota, governance, monitoring, and user/API workflows across hybrid infrastructure, with SaaS and self-hosted deployment paths. In current NVIDIA docs, Run:ai is part of the AI factory operations stack, appears in [[NVIDIA-AI-Enterprise]] guidance, and is integrated into [[NVIDIA-Mission-Control]] workflows for Kubernetes-native AI workload orchestration.

## Detail
The current NVIDIA Run:ai docs split users into SaaS and self-hosted product paths. SaaS is NVIDIA's fully managed cloud-hosted platform, while self-hosted is for on-premises and private cloud deployments aligned to cluster release cycles.

Self-hosted docs cover install, setup, monitoring, organizations and resources, model building/training/deployment, APIs, workload assets, permissions, policies, health/performance monitoring, telemetry, and the Run:ai Scheduler. This makes Run:ai the canonical page for questions about NVIDIA-managed AI workload submission, quota, teams/projects, policy-driven GPU access, and multi-tenant workload operations.

The Enterprise RA NIM LLM sizing paper uses Run:ai with vanilla Kubernetes to improve GPU utilization for [[NIM-for-Large-Language-Models]]. It focuses on dynamic scheduling, autoscaling, fractional GPUs, and multi-model packing. The paper reports that full-GPU NIM inference performance with Run:ai is comparable to non-Run:ai runs and that fractional GPU NIM workloads can scale linearly in the tested setup.

Run:ai also anchors open-source scheduling work. NVIDIA's product page links KAI Scheduler and Grove as open-source Run:ai ecosystem components: [[KAI-Scheduler]] for Kubernetes scheduling and [[NVIDIA-Grove]] for topology-optimized inference serving on Kubernetes. The same page mentions Run:ai Model Streamer as a model-loading acceleration feature, but this batch keeps it consolidated here until a separate current docs surface warrants its own page.
