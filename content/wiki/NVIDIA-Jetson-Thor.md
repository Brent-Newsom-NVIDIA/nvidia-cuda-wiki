## Summary
NVIDIA Jetson Thor is the Blackwell-generation Jetson platform for physical AI, humanoid robotics, advanced medical systems, and autonomous machines. Public NVIDIA material describes Jetson AGX Thor / T5000-class hardware with up to 2070 FP4 TFLOPS, 128 GB memory, a 14-core Arm Neoverse-V3AE CPU, Blackwell Tensor Cores, MIG support, PVA v3, high-speed camera/network I/O, and a JetPack 7 software stack. This page consolidates Jetson Thor/T5000/T4000 information into one canonical topic rather than separate pages for each SKU.

## Detail

### Purpose
Jetson Thor brings data-center-generation AI capabilities into a power-constrained embedded module for real-time physical AI. It targets robots and autonomous machines that need local multimodal reasoning, perception, planning, control, and sensor processing without round-tripping to the cloud.

### Key capabilities
- Blackwell-generation integrated GPU and Tensor Core stack for FP4/FP8 generative AI and VLA-style workloads.
- Up to 2070 FP4 TFLOPS and 128 GB memory on the top Thor/T5000-class configuration.
- Jetson T4000 tier with lower memory/performance/power targets for scaled physical AI deployments.
- MIG support for isolating workloads on a single embedded GPU, useful for mixed-criticality robot workloads.
- PVA v3, optical-flow acceleration, video encode/decode blocks, and high-speed camera connectivity for perception pipelines.
- QSFP, Ethernet, USB, PCIe, CAN, and other I/O on the developer kit for sensor fusion and robot prototyping.
- [[NVIDIA-JetPack-SDK]] 7.x and [[NVIDIA-Jetson-Linux]] 38.x software stack with Ubuntu 24.04/kernel 6.8-era platform direction.

### NVIDIA context
Jetson Thor is the deployment endpoint for NVIDIA's current physical AI stack. It connects [[NVIDIA-Isaac-GR00T]] humanoid foundation models, [[NVIDIA-Isaac-ROS]] deployment packages, [[NVIDIA-JetPack-SDK]] edge software, [[NVIDIA-Blackwell-Architecture]] compute capabilities, and [[NVIDIA-MIG]] workload partitioning in an embedded form factor.
