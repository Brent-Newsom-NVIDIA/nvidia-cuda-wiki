## Summary
NVIDIA HGX AI Factory is a current NVIDIA Enterprise Reference Architecture for building scalable AI factories with NVIDIA HGX B300 systems and Spectrum-X networking. It uses a 2-8-9-800 pattern with two CPUs, eight Blackwell Ultra GPUs, and nine network adapters at 800 Gb/s bandwidth per GPU class, with design points up to 128 nodes and 1024 B300 SXM GPUs.

## Detail

### Purpose
The HGX AI Factory pattern targets enterprise AI inference, AI training and fine-tuning, large-scale data analytics, and HPC workloads that need HGX-class bandwidth and multi-node scale in partner-built systems.

### Architecture notes
- The RA is based on NVIDIA-Certified HGX B300 systems, each with eight B300 SXM GPUs.
- HGX B300 baseboards use fifth-generation NVLink and NVSwitch with 14.4 TB/s total aggregate interconnect bandwidth and 1.8 TB/s GPU-to-GPU bandwidth.
- The documented pattern uses four-node scalable units and can scale to 32 SUs.
- ConnectX-8 SuperNICs support east-west GPU compute networking; BlueField-3 DPUs support north-south/customer and storage traffic.
- The design keeps Kubernetes central and treats software support as an [[NVIDIA-AI-Enterprise]] and [[NVIDIA-Run-ai]] subscription path.

### Software stack
The HGX AI Factory software page points to [[NVIDIA-AI-Enterprise]], [[NVIDIA-Base-Command-Manager]], [[NVIDIA-Run-ai]], and [[NVIDIA-NetQ]]. The broader software pattern belongs in [[NVIDIA-AI-Enterprise-Software-Reference-Architecture]], while monitoring belongs in [[NVIDIA-Enterprise-RA-Observability-Guide]].

### NVIDIA context
This page is the canonical wiki target for the HGX B300 Enterprise RA. Use [[NVIDIA-HGX]] for the platform/baseboard identity and [[NVIDIA-Enterprise-AI-Factory]] for the higher-level AI factory strategy.
