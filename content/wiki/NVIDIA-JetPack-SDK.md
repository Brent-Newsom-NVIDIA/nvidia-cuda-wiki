## Summary
NVIDIA JetPack SDK is the software stack for [[NVIDIA-Jetson-Platform]] devices. It bundles [[NVIDIA-Jetson-Linux]], CUDA-X libraries, AI frameworks, developer tools, samples, documentation, and higher-level SDK integration for edge AI and robotics. Current public NVIDIA material positions JetPack 7 as the next-generation stack for [[NVIDIA-Jetson-Thor]], with JetPack 6 in sustaining mode for Jetson Orin production deployments.

## Detail

### Purpose
JetPack turns Jetson modules and developer kits into usable edge AI development platforms. It provides the OS image, drivers, toolchain, CUDA/TensorRT/cuDNN software, computer vision and multimedia libraries, samples, and host/device development tools required to build, deploy, and optimize AI applications on Jetson.

### Current release positioning
- The Jetson documentation hub lists JetPack and Jetson Linux as separate documentation centers, with the archive listing JetPack 7.0 as the latest JetPack documentation branch.
- NVIDIA Jetson FAQ states that JetPack 7 supports Jetson Thor with Linux 24.04 LTS, Linux kernel 6.8, and the latest compute stack and libraries.
- NVIDIA developer blog material references JetPack 7.1 for Jetson T4000/Thor software features, including TensorRT Edge-LLM and Video Codec SDK support on Jetson Thor.
- JetPack 6 remains important for production Jetson Orin deployments and Jetson Platform Services support; exact selection should match the target module and release notes.

### Key components
- [[NVIDIA-Jetson-Linux]] board support package, kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, firmware, drivers, flashing tools, and APT update mechanisms.
- CUDA, cuDNN, [[TensorRT]], VPI, OpenCV, multimedia APIs, and NVIDIA video acceleration components.
- Developer tools including Nsight-family profiling/debugging tools, SDK Manager, samples, and host-side utilities.
- Higher-level integration with [[NVIDIA-Isaac-ROS]], [[NVIDIA-DeepStream]], [[NVIDIA-Riva]], [[NVIDIA-Jetson-Platform-Services]], and robotics/edge AI frameworks.
- Generative AI and physical AI support on Jetson Thor-class devices, including LLM, VLM, and VLA deployment paths.

## Connections
