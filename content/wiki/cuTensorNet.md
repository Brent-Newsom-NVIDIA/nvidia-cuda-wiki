## Summary
cuTensorNet is the tensor-network computation component of [[cuQuantum]]. It accelerates tensor network contraction, contraction-path search, slicing, tensor circuit state construction, matrix product state workflows, QR/SVD decompositions, and automatic distributed execution on NVIDIA GPUs. It sits between low-level tensor algebra such as [[cuTENSOR]] and higher-level quantum simulation paths in [[CUDA-Q]] and [[cuQuantum-Appliance]].

## Detail

### Purpose
State-vector simulation grows exponentially with qubit count, while tensor-network approaches can exploit circuit structure, low entanglement, or sliced contractions. cuTensorNet provides the NVIDIA-optimized tensor network runtime needed to search contraction paths, plan memory-aware execution, and run contractions efficiently on single-GPU, multi-GPU, and distributed systems.

### Current scope
- Tensor and tensor-network descriptor APIs.
- Cost-aware contraction path finding and slicing under memory constraints.
- Contraction plan generation, autotuning, and execution.
- Tensor circuit state construction for amplitudes, expectation values, marginal distributions, sampling, projections, and MPS compression.
- Backward differentiation for tensor network contractions.
- QR/SVD tensor decomposition and gate-splitting operations.
- Automatic distributed parallelization and custom memory-management hooks.

### NVIDIA context
cuTensorNet is the cuQuantum component for tensor-network simulation, while [[cuStateVec]] handles explicit state vectors, [[cuDensityMat]] handles analog quantum dynamics, [[cuPauliProp]] handles Pauli propagation, and [[cuStabilizer]] handles stabilizer-style simulation. The [[cuQuantum-Appliance]] packages these libraries into a container workflow for Qiskit and Cirq frontends.
