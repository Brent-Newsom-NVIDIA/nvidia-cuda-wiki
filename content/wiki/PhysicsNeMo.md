## Summary
PhysicsNeMo (formerly part of Modulus) is NVIDIA's open-source framework specifically designed for large-scale physics AI model training for geoscience, subsurface modeling, and industrial physics applications. It extends the NVIDIA Modulus physics-ML ecosystem with specialized architectures, datasets, and training workflows for Earth science domains including seismic imaging, weather modeling, reservoir simulation, and ocean dynamics. PhysicsNeMo is the framework powering NVIDIA's Earth-2 climate AI initiative's large-scale model training.

## Detail

### Purpose
PhysicsNeMo addresses the need for scalable, production-grade training of very large physics-AI models (billions of parameters) for geoscience and climate applications, where the models must learn from massive observational and simulation datasets while respecting physical constraints. It provides domain-specific model architectures, data loaders, and multi-node distributed training infrastructure for Earth and physics sciences.

### Key Features
- Specialized physics-ML architectures: Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO), Earth-2 FourCastNet, GraphCast-compatible GNN
- Distributed training across thousands of GPUs for continental/global-scale models
- Support for structured (latitude-longitude grids) and unstructured (mesh) geophysical data
- Data loaders for ERA5, CMIP6, and seismic datasets
- Physics-constrained loss functions for atmospheric, oceanic, and subsurface domains
- Built on PyTorch with Megatron-LM-style distribution for large model training
- Integration with NVIDIA Earth-2 inference and visualization platform
- Deployment adjacency with [[NIM-for-Earth-2-CorrDiff]] and [[NIM-for-Earth-2-FourCastNet]] for named Earth-2 inference microservices
- Deployment adjacency with [[NIM-for-DoMINO-Automotive-Aero]] for automotive external-aerodynamics surrogate inference.
- Multi-modal training support (combining observational + simulation data)
- Checkpoint compatibility with Modulus training pipelines

### Use Cases
- Global weather and climate AI model training (NWP surrogate models)
- Seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) neural surrogates
- Subsurface reservoir simulation with neural operators
- Ocean current and sea surface temperature forecasting
- Climate downscaling (coarse-to-fine resolution enhancement)
- Automotive external-aerodynamics surrogate simulation through [[NIM-for-DoMINO-Automotive-Aero]]
- Carbon capture and storage (CCS) subsurface modeling
- Tsunami and flood early warning systems

### Hardware Requirements
- NVIDIA A100 or H100 GPUs strongly recommended
- Multi-node clusters required for global-scale model training (1000+ GPUs typical)
- NVLink for intra-node; InfiniBand NDR for inter-node
- CUDA 11.8 or higher
- DGX SuperPOD or equivalent HPC cluster

### Language Bindings
- Python (primary)
- YAML/Hydra for experiment configuration
