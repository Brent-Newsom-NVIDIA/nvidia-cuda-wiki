# NVIDIA CUDA Knowledge Base

A Quartz 4 static site backed by a curated, interlinked markdown knowledge base covering NVIDIA's public CUDA platform, libraries, hardware, and ecosystem tooling.

## Content source

- **Canonical vault:** `content/`
- **Recommended editing model:** open `content/` directly as the Obsidian vault
- **Scope:** public NVIDIA/CUDA technical documentation - safe to publish broadly. No internal or confidential material.

Canonical structure under `content/`:

- `wiki/` - curated wiki pages (one per concept, library, hardware platform, etc.)
- `raw/` - raw source material (articles, transcripts, notes) used to build wiki pages
- `index.md` - Master Index, grouped by category
- `log.md` - ingestion history
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude-oriented agent instructions
- `codex.md` - Codex-oriented agent instructions

The older standalone `NVIDIA WIKI` desktop folder should be treated as a legacy/local copy unless it is explicitly resynced from `content/`. The repository is the source of truth.

## Updating content

1. Edit markdown directly in `content/`, or open `content/` as the Obsidian vault and work there.
2. Commit changes in this repo normally, or run `publish.bat` from the repo root to stage, commit, and push the latest content changes.

## Local preview

```bash
cd C:\Users\bnewsom\OneDrive - NVIDIA Corporation\Desktop\nvidia-cuda-wiki
npx quartz build --serve
```

The site is served at `http://localhost:8080` by default.

## Scripts

- **`scripts/audit-links.mjs`** - scans `content/` for broken `[[wikilinks]]` and writes a categorized report (space-vs-hyphen, case mismatches, genuinely missing targets) to `audit-links-report.txt` at the repo root. The report is gitignored; regenerate with:

  ```bash
  node scripts/audit-links.mjs
  ```

  Exits non-zero when issues are found, so it can gate a publish step.

## Hosting

Not yet configured. `baseUrl` in `quartz.config.ts` is set to a placeholder (`TODO-set-hosting-url.example.com`). Once the hosting destination is decided (GitHub Enterprise Pages or internal NVIDIA hosting are under consideration), update `baseUrl` as needed.

## Stack

- [Quartz 4](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) - Obsidian-aware static site generator
- Link resolution strategy: **shortest path** (matches Obsidian's default)
- Content strategy: **Empty Quartz** (new content folder, canonical vault content lives directly in-repo)
